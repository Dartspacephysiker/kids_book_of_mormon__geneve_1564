Background
-----------

I have grown tired of trying to find a version or translation of the Book of Mormon that is complete (i.e., unabridged), that uses language that is comprehensible to a child, and that moves toward more inclusive language. The time has come to strike out on my own!

Enter: The (Unofficial) International Children's Book of Mormon. I am using an ASCII text file of the Book of Mormon that I obtained at [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17).

I am chunking weekly portions of the ICBoM on https://internationalchildrensbookofmormon.blogspot.com/, to match the reading schedule for [*Come, Follow Me﻿—For Individuals and Families: Book of Mormon 2020*](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/come-follow-me-for-individuals-and-families-book-of-mormon-2020?lang=eng).

The layout for the ICBoM is directly ripped off `geneve_1564_modern.tex`, the modern-style Bible found in Raphaël Pinson's superb GitHub repository containing a [LaTeX replica](https://github.com/raphink/geneve_1564) of the [1564 Bible de Genève](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Bible). (I am a huge fan of your work, Raphaël!)
