I can see why these would be discouraged; I am not claiming to be a doctrinal expert. But the need for a complete Book of Mormon with simplified language and gender-neutralized language, as far as that is possible, is apparent.

Finished Mosiah 9. In replacing "slay" with "kill," I realized that telling about battles in kid language makes them feel particularly grave.

Outline
-------
1. Started using ICB seriously during last year's Come, Follow Me readings in the New Testament. We fell in love with the way that it linguistically (if not always conceptually) simplifies the message of the Bible. Gender equality and gender balance is a regular topic in our home, so we also liked encountering examples of inclusive language in the ICB.

Realizing that a Book of Mormon "answer" to the ICB does not exist, we were immediately faced with a problem. The Church's own "[name of kid BoM]" skips enormous portions of the Book of Mormon. Other versions [show here] are not free, and the one previous attempt of which we are aware to bring inclusive language into the Book of Mormon ["Easy-to-read BoM]" is hard to come by and totally not a feasible option for most people [$$ on eBay].

So where to go? Tough as it is to say—who wants to sound like they are speaking against the "cornerstone" of their own religion?—my wife and I have a hard time reading the Book of Mormon. We found ourselves wondering, "Why didn't we have this issue with the New Testament?" The obvious answer is that the approach that has been taken to Bible translation in the past few decades is much more liberal.

As mentioned, we had settled on the ICB for our family's New Testament reading. The ICB not a perfect solution, but it does solve many obvious problems [list]. For example, does anyone really believe that phrases and passages such as " [blatant example of male pronouns in BoM]" need to remain unchanged and unedited? Is it verboten to make the Word of God more accessble and applicable to more people?

As a side note, we recognize that the Bible and the Book of Mormon are both shining examples of patriarchy, no matter how inclusive you make the language. We are of the persuasion that Jesus Christ, Christianity, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are all worth sticking with, and that the Church and Christianity can and will, with time, move toward inclusivity and real equality in more than just words.

LINGUISTIC CHOICES
================
•Opt for "they, their, them" instead of "he, his, him" or "she, hers, her." (e.g., Mosiah 29:20; also see Farhad Manjoo's "It's Time for 'They'" https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/opinion/pronoun-they-gender.html) 

•Use both genders, or a gender-neutral term, where there seems to be no reason to preserve maleness beyond preserving the text as it was originally written (e.g., "queens and kings" instead of "kings" in Mosiah 29:16, or "rulers" instead of "kings" in Mosiah 29:21).

•Attempt to preserve poetic structure

•Attempt to preserve voice, either passive or active 

•"Children of men" → humankind

•"Abraham, Isaac, Jacob" → "Sarah and Abraham, and Rebekah and Isaac, and Rachel and Jacob"
