\bchapter
%Mosiah 1:1
\bverse \iffalse And now there was no more contention in all the land of Zarahemla, among all the people who belonged to king Benjamin, so that king Benjamin had continual peace all the remainder of his days. \fi
So there was no more fighting or arguing among King Benjamin's people in the land of Zarahemla, and King Benjamin had peace for the rest of his life.
%Mosiah 1:2
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that he had three sons; and he called their names Mosiah, and Helorum, and Helaman. And he caused that they should be taught in all the language of his fathers, that thereby they might become men of understanding; and that they might know concerning the prophecies which had been spoken by the mouths of their fathers, which were delivered them by the hand of the Lord. \fi
And King Benjamin had three sons. Their names were Mosiah, Helorum, and Helaman. King Benjamin arranged for his his sons to be taught the language and customs of their ancestors. He did this so that his sons could become wise, sensible people, and so that they would know the prophecies that the Lord had given to their ancestors.
%Mosiah 1:3
\bverse \iffalse And he also taught them concerning the records which were engraven on the plates of brass, saying: My sons, I would that ye should remember that were it not for these plates, which contain these records and these commandments, we must have suffered in ignorance, even at this present time, not knowing the mysteries of God. \fi
King Benjamin also taught his sons about the records engraven on the brass plates. He said, ``My sons, I want you to remember that these plates contain the records and commandments given to our ancestors. I also want you to remember that if we did not have these plates, we would suffer in ignorance and be unfamiliar with the mysteries of God.
%Mosiah 1:4
\bverse \iffalse For it were not possible that our father, Lehi, could have remembered all these things, to have taught them to his children, except it were for the help of these plates; for he having been taught in the language of the Egyptians therefore he could read these engravings, and teach them to his children, that thereby they could teach them to their children, and so fulfilling the commandments of God, even down to this present time. \fi
Without these plates it would have been impossible for Sarah and Lehi to remember all of these things, and to teachthem to their children. Lehi knew the language of the Egyptians, so he could read these engravings and teach them to their children. And Sariah and Lehi's children could then teach them to their children. This is how they kept the commandments of God, even down to this present time.
%Mosiah 1:5
\bverse \iffalse I say unto you, my sons, were it not for these things, which have been kept and preserved by the hand of God, that we might read and understand of his mysteries, and have his commandments always before our eyes, that even our fathers would have dwindled in unbelief, and we should have been like unto our brethren, the Lamanites, who know nothing concerning these things, or even do not believe them when they are taught them, because of the traditions of their fathers, which are not correct. \fi
My sons, I tell you that these records have been kept and preserved by the hand of God, so that we can read and understand God's mysteries, and have the commandments of God always before our eyes. Without these records our ancestors would have dwindled in unbelief, and we would be like our unbelieving relatives, the Lamanites. They do not know about these things. Even when the Lamanites learn about them, they do not believe them because of the traditions of their ancestors, which are not correct.
%Mosiah 1:6
\bverse \iffalse O my sons, I would that ye should remember that these sayings are true, and also that these records are true. And behold, also the plates of Nephi, which contain the records and the sayings of our fathers from the time they left Jerusalem until now, and they are true; and we can know of their surety because we have them before our eyes. \fi
My sons, I want you to remember that these sayings and records are true. I also want you to remember the plates of Nephi that contain the records and sayings of our ancestors from the time they left Jerusalem until now. They are also true. We can know that they are true because we can see them and read them.
%Mosiah 1:7
\bverse \iffalse And now, my sons, I would that ye should remember to search them diligently, that ye may profit thereby; and I would that ye should keep the commandments of God, that ye may prosper in the land according to the promises which the Lord made unto our fathers. \fi
Now, my sons, I want you to remember to search them diligently for your benefit. I want you to keep the commandments of God, so that you can prosper in this land according to the promises that the Lord made to our ancestors.''
%Mosiah 1:8
\bverse \iffalse And many more things did king Benjamin teach his sons, which are not written in this book. \fi
And king Benjamin taught his sons many other things that are not written in this book.
%Mosiah 1:9
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that after king Benjamin had made an end of teaching his sons, that he waxed old, and he saw that he must very soon go the way of all the earth; therefore, he thought it expedient that he should confer the kingdom upon one of his sons. \fi
After king Benjamin had finished teaching his sons, he became very old. He knew that he would soon go the way of all the earth and die, and he saw that the time had come to give leadership of the kingdom to one of his sons.
%Mosiah 1:10
\bverse \iffalse Therefore, he had Mosiah brought before him; and these are the words which he spake unto him, saying: My son, I would that ye should make a proclamation throughout all this land among all this people, or the people of Zarahemla, and the people of Mosiah who dwell in the land, that thereby they may be gathered together; for on the morrow I shall proclaim unto this my people out of mine own mouth that thou art a king and a ruler over this people, whom the Lord our God hath given us. \fi
He requested that Mosiah be brought to him, and this is what he said: ``My son, I want you to make a proclamation throughout the whole land, among everyone in Zarahemla and among Mosiah's people that also live here. I want them to gather together, because tomorrow I am going to proclaim to them with my own mouth that you are a king and a ruler over them, whom the Lord our God has given us.
%Mosiah 1:11
\bverse \iffalse And moreover, I will give this people a name, that thereby they may be distinguished above all the people which the Lord God hath brought out of the land of Jerusalem; and this I do because they have been a diligent people in keeping the commandments of the Lord. \fi
Furthermore, I will give this people a name that will distinguish them above all the people that the Lord God has brought out of the land of Jerusalem. I will do this because they have worked hard to keep the commandments of the Lord.
%Mosiah 1:12
\bverse \iffalse And I give unto them a name that never shall be blotted out, except it be through transgression. \fi
The name that I give them will never be erased, except through sin and transgression.
%Mosiah 1:13
\bverse \iffalse Yea, and moreover I say unto you, that if this highly favored people of the Lord should fall into transgression, and become a wicked and an adulterous people, that the Lord will deliver them up, that thereby they become weak like unto their brethren; and he will no more preserve them by his matchless and marvelous power, as he has hitherto preserved our fathers. \fi
What I am telling you is that the Lord has richly blessed this people. If they begin to sin and become a wicked and adulterous\footnote{The word \textit{adulterous} can mean both \textit{unfaithful} and \textit{sexually sinful}.} people the Lord will no longer stay with them, and they will become weak like their relatives. The Lord will stop protecting them with his matchless and marvelous power, the way that he has protected our ancestors until now.
%Mosiah 1:14
\bverse \iffalse For I say unto you, that if he had not extended his arm in the preservation of our fathers they must have fallen into the hands of the Lamanites, and become victims to their hatred. \fi
I tell you, if the Lord had not protected our ancestors they would have fallen into the hands of the Lamanites, and would have become victims of their hatred.''
%Mosiah 1:15
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that after king Benjamin had made an end of these sayings to his son, that he gave him charge concerning all the affairs of the kingdom. \fi
After king Benjamin had finished speaking to Mosiah, he gave Mosiah responsbility for all the business and affairs of the kingdom.
%Mosiah 1:16
\bverse \iffalse And moreover, he also gave him charge concerning the records which were engraven on the plates of brass; and also the plates of Nephi; and also, the sword of Laban, and the ball or director, which led our fathers through the wilderness, which was prepared by the hand of the Lord that thereby they might be led, every one according to the heed and diligence which they gave unto him. \fi
He also gave Mosiah responsibility for the records on the brass plates and the plates of Nephi, the sword of Laban, and the liahona that led our ancestors through the wilderness. The Lord prepared the liahona for them so that every one of them could be led, according to their diligence and how willing they were to be obedient to the Lord.
%Mosiah 1:17
\bverse \iffalse Therefore, as they were unfaithful they did not prosper nor progress in their journey, but were driven back, and incurred the displeasure of God upon them; and therefore they were smitten with famine and sore afflictions, to stir them up in remembrance of their duty. \fi
When they were unfaithful they did not prosper or progress in their journey. Instead of being led they were driven back, and they brought God's disapproval upon themselves. They experienced famine\footnote{A \textit{famine} is when there is not enough food to eat for days, weeks, months, or even years.} and very difficult trials that reminded them of their duty to God.
%Mosiah 1:18
\bverse \iffalse And now, it came to pass that Mosiah went and did as his father had commanded him, and proclaimed unto all the people who were in the land of Zarahemla that thereby they might gather themselves together, to go up to the temple to hear the words which his father should speak unto them. \fi
And so Mosiah obeyed his father. He went and proclaimed to all people in the land of Zaramhela that they should go to the temple and gather to hear king Benjamin speak.

I am also speaking to you who are poor, who only have enough to survive from day to day, and who do not help the beggar because you have nothing to give. I want you to say in your hearts, \lq I do not give anything because I do not have anything to give, but if I had anything to give, I would.\rq
%Mosiah 4:25
\bverse \iffalse And now, if ye say this in your hearts ye remain guiltless, otherwise ye are condemned; and your condemnation is just for ye covet that which ye have not received. \fi
If you say this in your hearts you are guiltless. But if you do not say this in your hearts, you are jealous of things that you do not have, and you are also guilty.
%Mosiah 4:26
\bverse \iffalse And now, for the sake of these things which I have spoken unto you--that is, for the sake of retaining a remission of your sins from day to day, that ye may walk guiltless before God--I would that ye should impart of your substance to the poor, every man according to that which he hath, such as feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and administering to their relief, both spiritually and temporally, according to their wants. \fi
For the sake of the things I have said---of always having daily forgiveness from God, and walking guiltless in the eyes of God---I want you to give what you are able to give to the poor, and feed the hungry, and give clothes to those that are naked or in rags, and visit the sick, and take care of their spiritual needs and the needs of their bodies.
%Mosiah 4:27
\bverse \iffalse And see that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength. And again, it is expedient that he should be diligent, that thereby he might win the prize; therefore, all things must be done in order. \fi

\bverse \iffalse And finally, I cannot tell you all the things whereby ye may commit sin; for there are divers ways and means, even so many that I cannot number them. \fi
Finally, I cannot tell you all the ways that you might commit sin. There are so many ways to sin that I cannot count them all.
%Mosiah 4:30
\bverse \iffalse But this much I can tell you, that if ye do not watch yourselves, and your thoughts, and your words, and your deeds, and observe the commandments of God, and continue in the faith of what ye have heard concerning the coming of our Lord, even unto the end of your lives, ye must perish.

We want to make a covenant\footnote{promise.} with our God, to do God's will and keep all the commandments that God gives us, for as long as we live. We want to do this, and not experience the never-ending torment that the angel spoke about or drink from the cup of God's anger.''
%Mosiah 5:6
\bverse \iffalse And now, these are the words which king Benjamin desired of them; and therefore he said unto them: Ye have spoken the words that I desired; and the covenant which ye have made is a righteous covenant. \fi
These were the words that the king Benjamin had hoped they would say, so he said to them: ``You have said what I hoped you would say, and the covenant that you have made is a righteous covenant.
%Mosiah 5:7
\bverse \iffalse And now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters. \fi
Because of this covenant that you have made, you will be called the children of Christ. You have been spiritually born of Christ, because you say that your hearts have changed because of your faith in his name. 
%Mosiah 5:8
\bverse \iffalse And under this head ye are made free, and there is no other head whereby ye can be made free. There is no other name given whereby salvation cometh; therefore, I would that ye should take upon you the name of Christ, all you that have entered into the covenant with God that ye should be obedient unto the end of your lives. \fi
When you become part of Christ's family you become free. There is no other person that can make you free; salvation comes only through the name of Christ. This is why I want all of you that have made a covenant with God to be obedient to the end of your life to accept the name of Christ and be called his children.
%Mosiah 5:9
\bverse \iffalse And it shall come to pass that whosoever doeth this shall be found at the right hand of God, for he shall know the name by which he is called; for he shall be called by the name of Christ. \fi
God will honor everyone that does this. Everyone that does this will know the name that they are called by. They will be called members of Christ's family.
%Mosiah 5:10
\bverse \iffalse And now it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall not take upon him the name of Christ must be called by some other name; therefore, he findeth himself on the left hand of God. \fi
Everyone that does not become a member of Christ's family must be called by a different name. God will not honor those people.
%Mosiah 5:11
\bverse \iffalse And I would that ye should remember also, that this is the name that I said I should give unto you that never should be blotted out, except it be through transgression; therefore, take heed that ye do not transgress, that the name be not blotted out of your hearts. \fi
I want you to remember that this is the name that I told you that I would give to you. This is the name that will never be erased except through sin. I tell you, be careful! Keep God's commandments, so that this name will remain in your hearts.
%Mosiah 5:12
\bverse \iffalse I say unto you, I would that ye should remember to retain the name written always in your hearts, that ye are not found on the left hand of God, but that ye hear and know the voice by which ye shall be called, and also, the name by which he shall call you. \fi
I want you to remember to always keep this name in your hearts and do what is right in God's eyes. If you do, you will hear and know God's voice when God calls to you. You will also know the name that God calls you by.
%Mosiah 5:13
\bverse \iffalse For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served, and who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart? \fi
How can someone know a master that they have not served, who is like a stranger to them? How can someone know a master that they do not think about or care about?
%Mosiah 5:14
\bverse \iffalse And again, doth a man take an ass which belongeth to his neighbor, and keep him? I say unto you, Nay; he will not even suffer that he shall feed among his flocks, but will drive him away, and cast him out. I say unto you, that even so shall it be among you if ye know not the name by which ye are called. \fi
Does a person take a donkey that belongs to their neighbor, and keep that donkey? No! That person will not allow the donkey to eat and graze with their flocks. That person will drive the donkey away. This is what will happen to you if you do not know the name that you are called by.
%Mosiah 5:15
\bverse \iffalse Therefore, I would that ye should be steadfast and immovable, always abounding in good works, that Christ, the Lord God Omnipotent, may seal you his, that you may be brought to heaven, that ye may have everlasting salvation and eternal life, through the wisdom, and power, and justice, and mercy of him who created all things, in heaven and in earth, who is God above all. Amen. \fi
I want you to be firm and not waver,\footnote{Be steadfast.} and to always do many good things. If you do this, the Lord God Almighty, who is Christ, will claim you as part of his family\footnote{Other editions of the Book of Mormon use the words ``seal you his.''} and you will be brought to heaven. You will have salvation and life forever because of the wisdom, power, justice, and mercy of God, who is above all things and who created everything that exists in heaven and on earth. Amen.''

%Mosiah 6:3
\bverse \iffalse And again, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had made an end of all these things, and had consecrated his son Mosiah to be a ruler and a king over his people, and had given him all the charges concerning the kingdom, and also had appointed priests to teach the people, that thereby they might hear and know the commandments of God, and to stir them up in remembrance of the oath which they had made, he dismissed the multitude, and they returned, every one, according to their families, to their own houses. \fi
After this King Benjamin appointed his son Mosiah to be a ruler and king over his people, and he gave Mosiah responsibility for the kingdom. King Benjamin also appointed priests to teach the people the commandments of God, and to remind them about the promises that they had made with God. After doing all of these things king Benjamin sent the crowds away, and they all returned to their houses with their families.
%Mosiah 6:4

And he also, himself, did till the earth, that thereby he might not become burdensome to his people, that he might do according to that which his father had done in all things. And there was no contention among all his people for the space of three years. \fi
And king Mosiah had his people plow fields and grow crops. He also plowed and worked in the fields, so that he would not be a burden to his people. He did his best to follow the example of his father. And they had peace in the land of Zarahemla for three years.
%Chapter 7
\bchapter
%Mosiah 7:1
\bverse \iffalse And now, it came to pass that after king Mosiah had had continual peace for the space of three years, he was desirous to know concerning the people who went up to dwell in the land of Lehi-Nephi, or in the city of Lehi-Nephi; for his people had heard nothing from them from the time they left the land of Zarahemla; therefore, they wearied him with their teasings. \fi
After having three years of peace, king Mosiah wanted to know what had become of the people who went to live in the land of Lehi-Nephi. No one had heard from these people since they left Zarahemla, and king Mosiah was getting tired of the people of Zarahemla nagging and disturbing him about this.
%Mosiah 7:2
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that king Mosiah granted that sixteen of their strong men might go up to the land of Lehi-Nephi to inquire concerning their brethren. \fi
So king Mosiah gave permission for sixteen strong men to go to the land of Lehi-Nephi and find out what had happened to these people.

These men did not know which way they should travel to get to the land of Lehi-Nephi. They wandered in the wilderness for forty days.

After they had wandered for forty days, they came to a hill that was north of the land of Shilom and pitched their tents.

%Mosiah 7:7

They ran into the king of the people that lived in the land of Nephi and the land of Shilom. The king's guards surrounded them and tied them up. Then Ammon and his brothers were taken and put into prison.

After they had been in prison for two days they were taken to the king and untied. They were given permission to speak, and commanded to answer the questions that the king had for them.
%Mosiah 7:9
\bverse \iffalse And he said unto them: Behold, I am Limhi, the son of Noah, who was the son of Zeniff, who came up out of the land of Zarahemla to inherit this land, which was the land of their fathers, who was made a king by the voice of the people. \fi
He said to them: ``My name is Limhi. My father is Noah, and his father was Zeniff, one of the people that left the land of Zarahemla to come back to this land, the land of our ancestors. The people here chose him as their king.
%Mosiah 7:10
\bverse \iffalse And now, I desire to know the cause whereby ye were so bold as to come near the walls of the city, when I, myself, was with my guards without the gate? \fi
I want to know: why did you dare to come near the walls of the city, when I, myself, was outside the city with my guards?
%Mosiah 7:11
\bverse \iffalse And now, for this cause have I suffered that ye should be preserved, that I might inquire of you, or else I should have caused that my guards should have put you to death. Ye are permitted to speak. \fi
I have kept you alive because I wanted to ask you about this. Otherwise I would have commanded my guards to put you to death. You can speak now.''
%Mosiah 7:12
\bverse \iffalse And now, when Ammon saw that he was permitted to speak, he went forth and bowed himself before the king; and rising again he said: O king, I am very thankful before God this day that I am yet alive, and am permitted to speak; and I will endeavor to speak with boldness; \fi
When Ammon saw that we has allowed to speak, he stepped toward the king and bowed down. He rose to his feet, and said: ``O King, today I am very thankful to God that I am still alive and that I am allowed to speak. I will try to speak boldly.
%Mosiah 7:13
\bverse \iffalse For I am assured that if ye had known me ye would not have suffered that I should have worn these bands. For I am Ammon, and am a descendant of Zarahemla, and have come up out of the land of Zarahemla to inquire concerning our brethren, whom Zeniff brought up out of that land. \fi
I am sure that if you had known who I am, you would not have tied me up and imprisoned me. My name is Ammon, and I am a descendant of Zarahemla. I have come from the land of Zarahemla to find out about our relatives, the ones that Zeniff brought out of that land.''
%Mosiah 7:14
\bverse \iffalse And now, it came to pass that after Limhi had heard the words of Ammon, he was exceedingly glad, and said: Now, I know of a surety that my brethren who were in the land of Zarahemla are yet alive. And now, I will rejoice; and on the morrow I will cause that my people shall rejoice also. \fi
When Limhi heard Ammon say this, it filled him with gladness. Limhi said: ``Now I am certain that my relatives in Zarahemla are still alive. I want to celebrate, and tomorrow I will arrange to have my people celebrate also.
%Mosiah 7:15
\bverse \iffalse For behold, we are in bondage to the Lamanites, and are taxed with a tax which is grievous to be borne. And now, behold, our brethren will deliver us out of our bondage, or out of the hands of the Lamanites, and we will be their slaves; for it is better that we be slaves to the Nephites than to pay tribute to the king of the Lamanites. \fi
You see, we are slaves to the Lamanites, and they require us to pay them very heavy taxes. But our family and relatives in Zarahemla will save us from this slavery and from the Lamanites, and we will be their slaves instead. It is better for us to be slaves to the Nephites than to pay heavy taxes to the king of the Lamanites.''
%Mosiah 7:16
\bverse \iffalse And now, king Limhi commanded his guards that they should no more bind Ammon nor his brethren, but caused that they should go to the hill which was north of Shilom, and bring their brethren into the city, that thereby they might eat, and drink, and rest themselves from the labors of their journey; for they had suffered many things; they had suffered hunger, thirst, and fatigue. \fi
Then king Limhi commanded his guards to let Ammon and his brothers go free. He sent Ammon and his brothers back to the hill that was north of Shilom to get the others that they were traveling with and bring them into the city, so that they could eat, drink, and rest from their journey. During their journey they had had many very difficult challenges, and they were thirsty, hungry, and exhausted.
%Mosiah 7:17
\bverse \iffalse And now, it came to pass on the morrow that king Limhi sent a proclamation among all his people, that thereby they might gather themselves together to the temple to hear the words which he should speak unto them. \fi
The next day king Limhi sent out a proclamation to all his people, telling them to come and gather at the temple to hear him speak.
%Mosiah 7:18
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that when they had gathered themselves together that he spake unto them in this wise, saying: O ye, my people, lift up your heads and be comforted; for behold, the time is at hand, or is not far distant, when we shall no longer be in subjection to our enemies, notwithstanding our many strugglings, which have been in vain; yet I trust there remaineth an effectual struggle to be made. \fi
When the people had gathered together he began speaking to them. He said: ``My dear people, lift up your heads and be comforted. Soon we will not be slaves to our enemies, even though we have struggled in vain; I have a feeling that we will have to continue to struggle.
%Mosiah 7:19
\bverse \iffalse Therefore, lift up your heads, and rejoice, and put your trust in God, in that God who was the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob; and also, that God who brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, and caused that they should walk through the Red Sea on dry ground, and fed them with manna that they might not perish in the wilderness; and many more things did he do for them. \fi
Lift up your heads and be glad, and put your trust in God. Put your trust in the God who was the God of Sarah and Abraham, and Rebekah and Isaac, and Rachel and Jacob---the God who brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt, and made it possible for them to walk through the Red Sea on dry ground, and fed them with manna so that they would not die in the wilderness. God also did many other things for them.
%Mosiah 7:20
\bverse \iffalse And again, that same God has brought our fathers out of the land of Jerusalem, and has kept and preserved his people even until now; and behold, it is because of our iniquities and abominations that he has brought us into bondage. \fi
This is the same God who brought our ancestors out of Jerusalem, and who has protected \Gpposs people up until this time. God has allowed us to become slaves because of our sins and the evil things we have done.
%Mosiah 7:21
\bverse \iffalse And ye all are witnesses this day, that Zeniff, who was made king over this people, he being over-zealous to inherit the land of his fathers, therefore being deceived by the cunning and craftiness of king Laman, who having entered into a treaty with king Zeniff, and having yielded up into his hands the possessions of a part of the land, or even the city of Lehi-Nephi, and the city of Shilom; and the land round about-- \fi
All of you are witnesses that Zeniff, the one that was chosen to be the king of this people, was very eager to return to the land of his ancestors. He was tricked by the slyness of king Laman when they agreed that Zeniff would give king Laman the city of Lehi-Nephi, the city of Shilom, and the land around them.
%Mosiah 7:22
\bverse \iffalse And all this he did, for the sole purpose of bringing this people into subjection or into bondage. And behold, we at this time do pay tribute to the king of the Lamanites, to the amount of one half of our corn, and our barley, and even all our grain of every kind, and one half of the increase of our flocks and our herds; and even one half of all we have or possess the king of the Lamanites doth exact of us, or our lives. \fi
King Laman did this so that he could rule over us and make us slaves. And you know that right now we pay a heavy tax to the king of the Lamanites: half of our corn and our barley, half of all the grain we grow, half of our flocks and herds, and half of everything we own. The king of the Lamanites says that we have to pay this, or else we will be killed.
%Mosiah 7:23
\bverse \iffalse And now, is not this grievous to be borne? And is not this, our affliction, great? Now behold, how great reason we have to mourn. \fi
Don't you think that this is a terrible burden? Don't you agree that we are really suffering? We have good reason to be unhappy and sorrowful.
%Mosiah 7:24
\bverse \iffalse Yea, I say unto you, great are the reasons which we have to mourn; for behold how many of our brethren have been slain, and their blood has been spilt in vain, and all because of iniquity. \fi
I tell you, we have many reasons to be sad. Think of how many of our family members and relatives have been killed. They have died because we made evil choices.
%Mosiah 7:25
\bverse \iffalse For if this people had not fallen into transgression the Lord would not have suffered that this great evil should come upon them. But behold, they would not hearken unto his words; but there arose contentions among them, even so much that they did shed blood among themselves. \fi
The Lord would not have allowed such terrible things to happen to us if we had not started to make sinful choices. But we did not want to listen to the Lord's words, or obey them. Instead, we have let ourselves argue and fight. Some of these fights have gotten so serious that people have died.
%Mosiah 7:26
\bverse \iffalse And a prophet of the Lord have they slain; yea, a chosen man of God, who told them of their wickedness and abominations, and prophesied of many things which are to come, yea, even the coming of Christ. \fi
Our people have even killed a prophet of the Lord. He was a man chosen by God. He told our people that their actions were very wrong and upsetting to God. He prophesied about things that are going to happen, and about the coming of Christ.
%Mosiah 7:27
\bverse \iffalse And because he said unto them that Christ was the God, the Father of all things, and said that he should take upon him the image of man, and it should be the image after which man was created in the beginning; or in other words, he said that man was created after the image of God, and that God should come down among the children of men, and take upon him flesh and blood, and go forth upon the face of the earth-- \fi
He said that Christ is the God and Father of all things. He said that Christ will look like a human, the same way that humans looked in the beginning, when they were created. He said that humans were created in God's image, and that God would come down among people with a body of flesh and blood, and walk on the earth.
%Mosiah 7:28
\bverse \iffalse And now, because he said this, they did put him to death; and many more things did they do which brought down the wrath of God upon them. Therefore, who wondereth that they are in bondage, and that they are smitten with sore afflictions? \fi
Because this prophet said these things, they killed him. They also did many other things that made God angry. It is not surprising that they are in slavery, and that they are suffering.
%Mosiah 7:29
\bverse \iffalse For behold, the Lord hath said: I will not succor my people in the day of their transgression; but I will hedge up their ways that they prosper not; and their doings shall be as a stumbling block before them. \fi
The Lord has said: \lq I will not help and take care of my people when they choose a life that is filled with sin. I will put things in their way so that they do not prosper. They will trip and stumble on the things that they have done.\rq
%Mosiah 7:30
\bverse \iffalse And again, he saith: If my people shall sow filthiness they shall reap the chaff thereof in the whirlwind; and the effect thereof is poison. \fi
The Lord says: \lq If my people sow seeds of filthiness, they will reap the husks of those seeds in a whirlwind. It will be like poison for them.\rq
%Mosiah 7:31
\bverse \iffalse And again he saith: If my people shall sow filthiness they shall reap the east wind, which bringeth immediate destruction. \fi
The Lord also says: \lq If my people sow seeds of filthiness they will reap the east wind. This wind brings immediate destruction.\rq
%Mosiah 7:32
\bverse \iffalse And now, behold, the promise of the Lord is fulfilled, and ye are smitten and afflicted. \fi
Now you can see for yourselves that the Lord's promises have been kept, and you are living with pain and suffering.
%Mosiah 7:33
\bverse \iffalse But if ye will turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart, and put your trust in him, and serve him with all diligence of mind, if ye do this, he will, according to his own will and pleasure, deliver you out of bondage. \fi
But if you turn to the Lord with all of your heart, and trust him, and serve him with all of your mind---if you do this, he will save you from this slavery when he thinks it is right.''

%Mosiah 8:1
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that after king Limhi had made an end of speaking to his people, for he spake many things unto them and only a few of them have I written in this book, he told his people all the things concerning their brethren who were in the land of Zarahemla. \fi
After king Limhi had finished speaking, he told his people everything about their relatives who were living in the land of Zarahemla. He said many things to his people, but I am only writing a few of them in this book.
%Mosiah 8:2

He had Ammon stand up in front of the crowd, and tell them everything that had happened to their relatives, from the time that Zeniff left the land until the time that Ammon himself had left the land.

Ammon recited the last words that king Benjamin had taught, and explained them to king Limhi's people so that they could understand what king Benjamin had said.
%Mosiah 8:4
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that after he had done all this, that king Limhi dismissed the multitude, and caused that they should return every one unto his own house. \fi
After Ammon did this king Limhi sent the people away, back to their homes.
%Mosiah 8:5
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that he caused that the plates which contained the record of his people from the time that they left the land of Zarahemla, should be brought before Ammon, that he might read them. \fi
Then king Limhi had plates containing the records of his people brought to Ammon, so that Ammon could read them. These plates told the story of king Limhi's people since the time that they had left the land of Zarahemla.
%Mosiah 8:6
\bverse \iffalse Now, as soon as Ammon had read the record, the king inquired of him to know if he could interpret languages, and Ammon told him that he could not. \fi
As soon as Ammon finished reading these plates, the king asked Ammon if he could interpret languages. Ammon said that he could not.
%Mosiah 8:7
\bverse \iffalse And the king said unto him: Being grieved for the afflictions of my people, I caused that forty and three of my people should take a journey into the wilderness, that thereby they might find the land of Zarahemla, that we might appeal unto our brethren to deliver us out of bondage. \fi
The king said to him: ``I was very sad about the suffering of my people, so I arranged for forty-three of them to travel into the wilderness to find the land of Zarahemla, and ask our kinfolk there to save us from slavery. 
%Mosiah 8:8
\bverse \iffalse And they were lost in the wilderness for the space of many days, yet they were diligent, and found not the land of Zarahemla but returned to this land, having traveled in a land among many waters, having discovered a land which was covered with bones of men, and of beasts, and was also covered with ruins of buildings of every kind, having discovered a land which had been peopled with a people who were as numerous as the hosts of Israel. \fi
They were lost in the wilderness for many days, but they were diligent. They did not find the land of Zarahemla, but they returned to this land after they had traveled in a land of many waters. They had discovered a land that was covered with human and animal bones, and with ruins of all sorts of buildings---a land that had once been filled with as many people as the people of Israel.
%Mosiah 8:9
\bverse \iffalse And for a testimony that the things that they had said are true they have brought twenty-four plates which are filled with engravings, and they are of pure gold. \fi
To show that what they have said is true, they have brought with them twenty-four plates of pure gold that are filled with engravings.
%Mosiah 8:10
\bverse \iffalse And behold, also, they have brought breastplates, which are large, and they are of brass and of copper, and are perfectly sound. \fi
They have also brought back large breastplates made of brass and copper that are in very good condition.

\bverse \iffalse And again, they have brought swords, the hilts thereof have perished, and the blades thereof were cankered with rust; and there is no one in the land that is able to interpret the language or the engravings that are on the plates. Therefore I said unto thee: Canst thou translate? \fi
They have also brought swords, but the handles are badly worn\footnote{Other editions of the Book of Mormon use the words ``have perished.''} and the blades are rusty. There is no one here that can interpret the language or the engravings on the plates. This is why I asked you, \lq Can you translate?\rq
%Mosiah 8:12
\bverse \iffalse And I say unto thee again: Knowest thou of any one that can translate? For I am desirous that these records should be translated into our language; for, perhaps, they will give us a knowledge of a remnant of the people who have been destroyed, from whence these records came; or, perhaps, they will give us a knowledge of this very people who have been destroyed; and I am desirous to know the cause of their destruction. \fi
And I ask you again: Do you know of anyone that can translate? I want these records to be translated into our language, because they might give us knowledge about some survivors of the people who have been destroyed where these records came from. Or maybe the records will give us knowledge of the very people who have been destroyed. I want to know what caused their destruction.''
%Mosiah 8:13
\bverse \iffalse Now Ammon said unto him: I can assuredly tell thee, O king, of a man that can translate the records; for he has wherewith that he can look, and translate all records that are of ancient date; and it is a gift from God. And the things are called interpreters, and no man can look in them except he be commanded, lest he should look for that he ought not and he should perish.  And whosoever is commanded to look in them, the same is called seer. \fi
Then Ammon said to him: ``I certainly can tell you, O king, about a man who can translate these records. He has instruments that let him look, and translate any record from ancient times. It is a gift from God. The instruments are called interpreters, and no one can look in them except they are commanded, to keep them from looking for something that they should not look for and die. Anyone that is commanded to look in them is called a seer.

But a seer can know about things from the past, and about things that will come. And by them all things will be revealed---or in other words, they will reveal secret and hidden things. They will reveal things that are not known, and they will reveal and make known things that otherwise could not be known.

When Ammon finished speaking the king rejoiced greatly and gave thanks to God. He said:  ``There is no doubt a great mystery written on these plates, and no doubt that these interpreters were prepared for revealing these mysteries to humankind.''
%Mosiah 8:20

\bverse \iffalse Therefore, I contended with my brethren in the wilderness for I would that our ruler should make a treaty with them; but he being an austere and a bloodthirsty man commanded that I should be slain; but I was rescued by the shedding of much blood; for father fought against father, and brother against brother, until the greater number of our army was destroyed in the wilderness; and we returned, those of us that were spared, to the land of Zarahemla, to relate that tale to their wives and their children. \fi
I argued with my kin in the wilderness, because I wanted our leader to make a treaty with the lamanites. But our leader was a harsh, bloodthirsty man, and he commanded that I be killed.

The few of us that survived went back to the land of Zarahemla to tell this story to the families of those who had died.
%Mosiah 9:3
\bverse \iffalse And yet, I being over-zealous to inherit the land of our fathers, collected as many as were desirous to go up to possess the land, and started again on our journey into the wilderness to go up to the land; but we were smitten with famine and sore afflictions; for we were slow to remember the Lord our God. \fi
But I was still very eager to go and live in the land of our ancestors, so I gathered everyone that wanted to return to live in that land, and we started again on our journey through the wilderness to go to that land.

They were wild and brutal people who loved murder.

%Mosiah 10:13
\bverse \iffalse And again, that they were wronged while in the land of their first inheritance, after they had crossed the sea, and all this because that Nephi was more faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord--therefore he was favored of the Lord, for the Lord heard his prayers and answered them, and he took the lead of their journey in the wilderness. \fi
They also believed that were treated unfairly when they came to the promised land, after they had crossed the ocean.

But did they understand the law? No, they did not all understand the law because their hearts were hard.

%Mosiah 13:33

\bverse \iffalse He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. \fi
He was hated and rejected by people. His life was filled with sadness and pain, and we would not even look at him. He was hated, and we did not care about him or think about him.
%Mosiah 14:4
\bverse \iffalse Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. \fi

\bverse \iffalse And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no evil, neither was any deceit in his mouth. \fi
He was given a grave among the wicked, and he died with the rich. He had never done wrong, and he had never lied.

But it was the Lord's will to bruise him and make him grieve. When his soul is made a sacrifice for sin, he will see his descendants. He will live a long life, and he will make things that please the Lord prosper.
%Mosiah 14:11
\bverse \iffalse He shall see the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied; by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities. \fi
When he sees what his suffering has accomplished, he will be satisfied. By his experience my righteous servant will make many people right with God, because he carried away their sins.

I will give him a very great reward, and he will share the riches of his victory with the strong. I will do this because he gave his whole soul, and even died, willingly. He was treated like a sinner, and he carried the sins of many people, and asked forgiveness for their sins.\rq ''

So, when the flesh is ruled by the Spirit (or when the Son is ruled by the Father, as one God), he will allow himself to be tempted. He will not give in to that temptation. He will let himself be mocked, and beaten, and thrown out, and rejected by his people.
%Mosiah 15:6
\bverse \iffalse And after all this, after working many mighty miracles among the children of men, he shall be led, yea, even as Isaiah said, as a sheep before the shearer is dumb, so he opened not his mouth. \fi

But to you I say, be afraid, and shake and tremble before God! You should be shaking and trembling, because the Lord will not redeem anyone that rebels against him and dies in their sins. He will not redeem anyone who has died since the world began, who died in their sins and wilfully rebelled against God---the people who knew the commandments of God but did not want to keep them. These people will not be a part of the first resurrection.

Then the people that choose evil will be thrown out, and they will have good reason to howl, and cry, and moan, and grind their teeth in pain. This is because they did not want to listen to the Lord's voice. The Lord does not redeem them.

Their thinking is controlled by their sinful selves and by devilish thoughts. The devil has power over them. I mean the devil that tricked our first parents and caused them to fall. The fall was the reason that all humankind became selfish, lustful, and devilish. The fall was also the reason that all humankind knows the difference between good and evil, and let themselves be influenced by the devil.
%Mosiah 16:4
\bverse \iffalse Thus all mankind were lost; and behold, they would have been endlessly lost were it not that God redeemed his people from their lost and fallen state. \fi
So all humankind was lost, and they would be lost forever if God did not save \Gpposs people from being lost and fallen.
%Mosiah 16:5
\bverse \iffalse But remember that he that persists in his own carnal nature, and goes on in the ways of sin and rebellion against God, remaineth in his fallen state and the devil hath all power over him. Therefore, he is as though there was no redemption made, being an enemy to God; and also is the devil an enemy to God. \fi
But remember this: the people that let themselves be controlled by what their body wants, and go on living in a sinful way and rebelling against God, will stay this way. The devil will have power over them. For them it is like there is no such thing as salvation, and they are enemies to God. The devil is also an enemy to God.
%Mosiah 16:6
\bverse \iffalse And now if Christ had not come into the world, speaking of things to come as though they had already come, there could have been no redemption. \fi
I will speak about future things as if they had already happened: If Christ did not come into the world, there could not be any salvation.
%Mosiah 16:7
\bverse \iffalse And if Christ had not risen from the dead, or have broken the bands of death that the grave should have no victory, and that death should have no sting, there could have been no resurrection. \fi
If Christ did not rise from the dead and break the bands of death, so that death has no victory and no power to harm, there would not be any resurrection.
%Mosiah 16:8

But there is a resurrection. And now death has no victory, and death's power to harm is swallowed up by Christ.

These bodies that die will clothe themselves in immortality. These bodies that die, and rot and fade away, will be changed so that they no longer die and fade away. And they will be brought to stand in front of God's judgment bar, where they will be judged by God according to the things they have done, whether they are good or evil.

\bverse \iffalse If they be good, to the resurrection of endless life and happiness; and if they be evil, to the resurrection of endless damnation, being delivered up to the devil, who hath subjected them, which is damnation-- \fi
If what they have done is good, they will be resurrected and have endless life and happiness. If what they have done is evil, they will be resurrected and be guilty forever. They will be given over to the devil, who has taken control of them. This is what damnation is.

Such people have lived only for what their bodies want, and what their bodies tell them to do. They never called on the Lord while mercy's arms were reached out to them. Mercy's arms were reached out to them, but they would not reach back. They were warned about their sins, but they would not leave their sins behind. They were commanded to change their ways, but they did not want to change their ways.

\bverse \iffalse And now, ought ye not to tremble and repent of your sins, and remember that only in and through Christ ye can be saved? \fi
Shouldn't you tremble and shake, and repent of your sins? Shouldn't you remember that you can only be saved through Christ, and in Christ?
