\bchapter
%Helaman 1:1
\bverse \iffalse And now behold, it came to pass in the commencement of the fortieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, there began to be a serious difficulty among the people of the Nephites. \fi
And now, in the beginning of the fortieth year of the judges over the people of Nephi, there began to be serious problems among the Nephites.
%Helaman 1:2
\bverse \iffalse For behold, Pahoran had died, and gone the way of all the earth; therefore there began to be a serious contention concerning who should have the judgment-seat among the brethren, who were the sons of Pahoran. \fi
Pahoran had died, and gone the way of all the earth. And there began to be a serious argument about which one of Pahoran's sons was supposed to be the next chief judge.
%Helaman 1:3
\bverse \iffalse Now these are their names who did contend for the judgment-seat, who did also cause the people to contend: Pahoran, Paanchi, and Pacumeni. \fi
These are the names of the three sons who argued that they should be the next chief judge, and got the people into an argument: Pahoran, Paanchi, and Pacumeni. 
%Helaman 1:4
\bverse \iffalse Now these are not all the sons of Pahoran, (for he had many) but these are they who did contend for the judgment-seat; therefore, they did cause three divisions among the people. \fi
These are not all the sons of Pahoran; he had many others. But these are the three who tried to become the next chief judge. And they caused the people to split into three groups.
%Helaman 1:5
\bverse \iffalse Nevertheless, it came to pass that Pahoran was appointed by the voice of the people to be chief judge and a governor over the people of Nephi. \fi
But Pahoran was chosen by the voice of the people to be chief judge and a governor over the people of Nephi.
%Helaman 1:6
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that Pacumeni, when he saw that he could not obtain the judgment-seat, he did unite with the voice of the people. \fi
And when Pacumeni saw that he could not become the chief judge, he joined with the voice of the people and no longer argued.
%Helaman 1:7
\bverse \iffalse But behold, Paanchi, and that part of the people that were desirous that he should be their governor, was exceedingly wroth; therefore, he was about to flatter away those people to rise up in rebellion against their brethren. \fi
But Paanchi and the people that wanted him to be the governor were furious. He began to try to flatter his followers, and convince them to rebel against the rest of the people.
%Helaman 1:8
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass as he was about to do this, behold, he was taken, and was tried according to the voice of the people, and condemned unto death; for he had raised up in rebellion and sought to destroy the liberty of the people. \fi
And as he was about to do this, he was taken and judged according to the voice of the people. He was sentenced to death, because he had tried to start a rebellion and destroy the freedom of the people.
%Helaman 1:9
\bverse \iffalse Now when those people who were desirous that he should be their governor saw that he was condemned unto death, therefore they were angry, and behold, they sent forth one Kishkumen, even to the judgment-seat of Pahoran, and murdered Pahoran as he sat upon the judgment-seat. \fi
And when the people who wanted him to be their governor saw that he had been sentenced to death, they were angry. They sent out a man named Kishkumen to the judgment-seat of Pahoran, and Kishkumen murdered Pahoran as he was sitting on the judgment-seat.
%Helaman 1:10
\bverse \iffalse And he was pursued by the servants of Pahoran; but behold, so speedy was the flight of Kishkumen that no man could overtake him. \fi
He was chased by Pahoran's servants, but he ran so quickly that no one could catch up to him.
%Helaman 1:11
\bverse \iffalse And he went unto those that sent him, and they all entered into a covenant, yea, swearing by their everlasting Maker, that they would tell no man that Kishkumen had murdered Pahoran. \fi
And he went back to the people that sent him, and they all made a covenant, and swore in the name of their eternal Maker, God, that they would never tell anyone that Kishkumen had murdered Pahoran.
%Helaman 1:12
\bverse \iffalse Therefore, Kishkumen was not known among the people of Nephi, for he was in disguise at the time that he murdered Pahoran. And Kishkumen and his band, who had covenanted with him, did mingle themselves among the people, in a manner that they all could not be found; but as many as were found were condemned unto death. \fi
So the people of Nephi did not find out what Kishkumen had done, because he was in disguise when he had murdered Pahoran. And Kishkumen, and the people who had made a covenant of secrecy with him, went out among the people. They kept their secret so well that the people could not find out who all of them were. But the ones that were found were put to death.
%Helaman 1:13
\bverse \iffalse And now behold, Pacumeni was appointed, according to the voice of the people, to be a chief judge and a governor over the people, to reign in the stead of his brother Pahoran; and it was according to his right. And all this was done in the fortieth year of the reign of the judges; and it had an end. \fi
And Pacumeni was chosen by the voice of the people to be a chief judge and a governor instead of his brother, Pahoran; it was Pacumeni's right to be the next chief judge and governor. All of this happened in the fortieth year of the judges. And that year ended.
%Helaman 1:14
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass in the forty and first year of the reign of the judges, that the Lamanites had gathered together an innumerable army of men, and armed them with swords, and with cimeters and with bows, and with arrows, and with head-plates, and with breastplates, and with all manner of shields of every kind. \fi
And in the forty and first year of the judges, the Lamanites had gathered together an army that was so large that their soldiers could not be counted. They were armed with swords, short swords, bows, arrows, helmets, breastplates, and all sorts of shields of every kind.
%Helaman 1:15
\bverse \iffalse And they came down again that they might pitch battle against the Nephites. And they were led by a man whose name was Coriantumr; and he was a descendant of Zarahemla; and he was a dissenter from among the Nephites; and he was a large and a mighty man. \fi
And they came out to battle against the Nephites. They were led by a man named Coriantumr. He was a descendant of Zarahemla, and he had rebelled against the Nephites. He was a large and very strong man.
%Helaman 1:16
\bverse \iffalse Therefore, the king of the Lamanites, whose name was Tubaloth, who was the son of Ammoron, supposing that Coriantumr, being a mighty man, could stand against the Nephites, with his strength and also with his great wisdom, insomuch that by sending him forth he should gain power over the Nephites-- \fi
The king of the Lamanites, whose name was Tubaloth, was the son of Ammoron. He thought that Coriantumr was a mighty and very wise man. He thought that if he sent Coriantumr out with the Lamanite army, Coriantumr could defeat the Nephites and give Tubaloth control over them.
%Helaman 1:17
\bverse \iffalse Therefore he did stir them up to anger, and he did gather together his armies, and he did appoint Coriantumr to be their leader, and did cause that they should march down to the land of Zarahemla to battle against the Nephites. \fi
So he stirred the Lamanites up and made them angry, and gathered his armies together, and made Coriantumr their leader. He commanded them to march to the land of Zarahemla and battle against the Nephites.  
%Helaman 1:18
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that because of so much contention and so much difficulty in the government, that they had not kept sufficient guards in the land of Zarahemla; for they had supposed that the Lamanites durst not come into the heart of their lands to attack that great city Zarahemla. \fi
And because there were so many fights and problems in the government of the Nephites, they had not kept enough guards in the land of Zarahemla. Besides, they did not believe that the Lamanites would dare to come into the heart of their lands and attack the great city Zarahemla.
%Helaman 1:19
\bverse \iffalse But it came to pass that Coriantumr did march forth at the head of his numerous host, and came upon the inhabitants of the city, and their march was with such exceedingly great speed that there was no time for the Nephites to gather together their armies. \fi
But Coriantumr marched at the front of his enormous army, and attacked the people of Zarahemla. They marched so quickly that the Nephites had no time to gather their armies together.
%Helaman 1:20
\bverse \iffalse Therefore Coriantumr did cut down the watch by the entrance of the city, and did march forth with his whole army into the city, and they did slay every one who did oppose them, insomuch that they did take possession of the whole city. \fi
Coriantumr cut down the guards at the entrance of the city, and marched with his whole army into the city. They killed anyone who tried to stop them, and they took control of the entire city.
%Helaman 1:21
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that Pacumeni, who was the chief judge, did flee before Coriantumr, even to the walls of the city. And it came to pass that Coriantumr did smite him against the wall, insomuch that he died. And thus ended the days of Pacumeni. \fi
And Pacumeni, the chief judge, ran away from Coriantumr out to the walls of the city. And Coriantumr slammed Pacumeni against the wall so hard that he died. This was the end of Pacumeni's days.
%Helaman 1:22
\bverse \iffalse And now when Coriantumr saw that he was in possession of the city of Zarahemla, and saw that the Nephites had fled before them, and were slain, and were taken, and were cast into prison, and that he had obtained the possession of the strongest hold in all the land, his heart took courage insomuch that he was about to go forth against all the land. \fi
And now, Coriantumr saw that he had control of the city of Zarahemla, and that the Nephites had either been killed, or had run away from him, or had been thrown into prison. He saw that he had taken control of the strongest city in all the land. And when he saw all of this, it filled him with courage to go and attack the rest of the country.
%Helaman 1:23
\bverse \iffalse And now he did not tarry in the land of Zarahemla, but he did march forth with a large army, even towards the city of Bountiful; for it was his determination to go forth and cut his way through with the sword, that he might obtain the north parts of the land. \fi
He did not wait in Zarahemla; instead, he marched with his large army toward the city of Bountiful. He had decided that he and his army would go and cut their way through with swords, until they got control of the northern parts of the land.
%Helaman 1:24
\bverse \iffalse And, supposing that their greatest strength was in the center of the land, therefore he did march forth, giving them no time to assemble themselves together save it were in small bodies; and in this manner they did fall upon them and cut them down to the earth. \fi
He thought that the Nephites were strongest in the center of the land, so he marched out, and gave the Nephites very little time to gather together. They could only gather together in small groups, but Coriantumr and his army attacked them and killed them.
%Helaman 1:25
\bverse \iffalse But behold, this march of Coriantumr through the center of the land gave Moronihah great advantage over them, notwithstanding the greatness of the number of the Nephites who were slain. \fi
But Coriantumr's choice to march through the center of the land gave Moronihah a great advantage over them, even though they had killed very many Nephites.
%Helaman 1:26
\bverse \iffalse For behold, Moronihah had supposed that the Lamanites durst not come into the center of the land, but that they would attack the cities round about in the borders as they had hitherto done; therefore Moronihah had caused that their strong armies should maintain those parts round about by the borders. \fi
Moronihah did not think that the Lamanites would dare to come into the center of the land. He thought that they would attack the cities on the borders, as they had done before. This is why Moronihah had placed the strongest armies near the borders of the land.
%Helaman 1:27
\bverse \iffalse But behold, the Lamanites were not frightened according to his desire, but they had come into the center of the land, and had taken the capital city which was the city of Zarahemla, and were marching through the most capital parts of the land, slaying the people with a great slaughter, both men, women, and children, taking possession of many cities and of many strongholds. \fi
But the Lamanites were not scared, as Moronihah thought they would be. The Lamanites had come into the center of the land, and captured the capital city, Zarahemla. They were marching through the largest cities in the land, killing children, women, and men, and taking control of many cities, forts, and defenses.
%Helaman 1:28
\bverse \iffalse But when Moronihah had discovered this, he immediately sent forth Lehi with an army round about to head them before they should come to the land Bountiful. \fi
When Moronihah found out about this, he immediately sent out Lehi with an army to run into the Lamanite army before they arrived at the land Bountiful.
%Helaman 1:29
\bverse \iffalse And thus he did; and he did head them before they came to the land Bountiful, and gave unto them battle, insomuch that they began to retreat back towards the land of Zarahemla. \fi
Lehi did this. He ran into them before they reached the land Bountiful, and began to fight them. The Lamanites began to retreat back towards the land of Zarahemla.
%Helaman 1:30
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that Moronihah did head them in their retreat, and did give unto them battle, insomuch that it became an exceedingly bloody battle; yea, many were slain, and among the number who were slain Coriantumr was also found. \fi
And Moronihah ran into them on the other side, as they were retreating, and began to battle with them. It became a very bloody battle. Many were killed, and Coriantumr was also killed.
%Helaman 1:31
\bverse \iffalse And now, behold, the Lamanites could not retreat either way, neither on the north, nor on the south, nor on the east, nor on the west, for they were surrounded on every hand by the Nephites. \fi
And the Lamanites could not retreat in any direction---neither to the north, nor to the south, nor to the east, nor to the west, because they were surrounded on every side by the Nephites.
%Helaman 1:32
\bverse \iffalse And thus had Coriantumr plunged the Lamanites into the midst of the Nephites, insomuch that they were in the power of the Nephites, and he himself was slain, and the Lamanites did yield themselves into the hands of the Nephites. \fi
Coriantumr had put his army right in the middle of the lands of the Nephites, and the Nephites had power over them. Coriantumr himself was killed, and the Lamanites gave themselves up to the Nephites.
%Helaman 1:33
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that Moronihah took possession of the city of Zarahemla again, and caused that the Lamanites who had been taken prisoners should depart out of the land in peace. \fi
And Moronihah regained control of the city of Zarahemla. He released the Lamanites who had been taken prisoners and allowed them to leave the land in peace.
%Helaman 1:34
\bverse \iffalse And thus ended the forty and first year of the reign of the judges. \fi
And the forty-first year of the judges ended.
%Chapter 2
\bchapter
%Helaman 2:1
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass in the forty and second year of the reign of the judges, after Moronihah had established again peace between the Nephites and the Lamanites, behold there was no one to fill the judgment-seat; therefore there began to be a contention again among the people concerning who should fill the judgment-seat. \fi
And in the forty-second year of the judges, after Moronihah had once again made peace between the Nephites and Lamanites, there was no one left who had a right to become the chief judge. And another argument broke out among the Nephites about who should become the next chief judge.
%Helaman 2:2
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that Helaman, who was the son of Helaman, was appointed to fill the judgment-seat, by the voice of the people. \fi
And Helaman, the son of Helaman, was chosen as the next chief judge by the voice of the people.
%Helaman 2:3
\bverse \iffalse But behold, Kishkumen, who had murdered Pahoran, did lay wait to destroy Helaman also; and he was upheld by his band, who had entered into a covenant that no one should know his wickedness. \fi
But Kishkumen, the one who had murdered Pahoran, was waiting for a chance to also murder Helaman. He was supported by his gang, who had made a covenant to protect him so that no one could find out what evil things he had done.
%Helaman 2:4
\bverse \iffalse For there was one Gadianton, who was exceedingly expert in many words, and also in his craft, to carry on the secret work of murder and of robbery; therefore he became the leader of the band of Kishkumen. \fi
One of them was named Gadianton. He was an expert with words, and he was an expert in both murder and robbery. And he became the leader of Kishkumen's gang.
%Helaman 2:5
\bverse \iffalse Therefore he did flatter them, and also Kishkumen, that if they would place him in the judgment-seat he would grant unto those who belonged to his band that they should be placed in power and authority among the people; therefore Kishkumen sought to destroy Helaman. \fi
He flattered them, and Kishkumen, that if they would help him to become the chief judge, he would let anyone that was a part of his gang be put into positions of power and authority among the people. This is why Kishkumen wanted to murder Helaman.
%Helaman 2:6
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass as he went forth towards the judgment-seat to destroy Helaman, behold one of the servants of Helaman, having been out by night, and having obtained, through disguise, a knowledge of those plans which had been laid by this band to destroy Helaman-- \fi
One of Helaman's servants had been out at night, and had disguised himself. He found out about the plan to murder Helaman. And Kishkumen went out to the judgment-seat to murder Helaman.
%Helaman 2:7
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that he met Kishkumen, and he gave unto him a sign; therefore Kishkumen made known unto him the object of his desire, desiring that he would conduct him to the judgment-seat that he might murder Helaman. \fi
And when Helaman's servant met Kishkumen, he gave Kishkumen a secret sign. So Kishkumen told him what he was doing, and told the servant to take him to the judgment-seat so that he could murder Helaman.
%Helaman 2:8
\bverse \iffalse And when the servant of Helaman had known all the heart of Kishkumen, and how that it was his object to murder, and also that it was the object of all those who belonged to his band to murder, and to rob, and to gain power, (and this was their secret plan, and their combination) the servant of Helaman said unto Kishkumen: Let us go forth unto the judgment-seat. \fi
And when the servant of Helaman finally saw what was in Kishkumen's heart---that he wanted to murder, and that everyone in his gang wanted to murder, and rob, and get power (this was their secret plan, and the purpose of their gang)---the servant said to Kishkumen: ``Let us go to the judgment-seat.''
%Helaman 2:9
\bverse \iffalse Now this did please Kishkumen exceedingly, for he did suppose that he should accomplish his design; but behold, the servant of Helaman, as they were going forth unto the judgment-seat, did stab Kishkumen even to the heart, that he fell dead without a groan. And he ran and told Helaman all the things which he had seen, and heard, and done. \fi
Kishkumen was very pleased to hear this, because he thought he was going to accomplish his plan. But as they were going to the judgment-seat, the servant of Helaman stabbed Kishkumen in the heart, so that he died without making a single noise. And the servant ran and told Helaman everything that he had heard, and seen, and done.
%Helaman 2:10
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that Helaman did send forth to take this band of robbers and secret murderers, that they might be executed according to the law. \fi
And Helaman sent out guards to take this gang of robbers and secret murderers, and put them to death according to the law.
%Helaman 2:11
\bverse \iffalse But behold, when Gadianton had found that Kishkumen did not return he feared lest that he should be destroyed; therefore he caused that his band should follow him. And they took their flight out of the land, by a secret way, into the wilderness; and thus when Helaman sent forth to take them they could nowhere be found. \fi
But when Gadianton realized that Kishkumen never came back, he was afraid that he would get caught and be put to death. So he made his gang follow him, and they left the land using a secret path into the wilderness. And the guards that Helaman had sent out could not find them anywhere.
%Helaman 2:12
\bverse \iffalse And more of this Gadianton shall be spoken hereafter. And thus ended the forty and second year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi. \fi
I will say more about this Gadianton later. And the forty-second year of the judges over the people of Nephi ended.
%Helaman 2:13
\bverse \iffalse And behold, in the end of this book ye shall see that this Gadianton did prove the overthrow, yea, almost the entire destruction of the people of Nephi. \fi
And at the end of this book you will see that this Gadianton almost caused the people of Nephi to be entirely destroyed.
%Helaman 2:14
\bverse \iffalse Behold I do not mean the end of the book of Helaman, but I mean the end of the book of Nephi, from which I have taken all the account which I have written. \fi
I do not mean the end of the book of Helaman; I mean the end of the book of Nephi. This is the book that I have taken everything I have written from.
%Chapter 3
\bchapter
%Helaman 3:1
\bverse \iffalse And now it came to pass in the forty and third year of the reign of the judges, there was no contention among the people of Nephi save it were a little pride which was in the church, which did cause some little dissensions among the people, which affairs were settled in the ending of the forty and third year. \fi
And in the forty-third year of the judges there were no serious problems among the people of Nephi expect for a little pride in the church. This caused some small arguments among the people, but these arguments were put in order by the end of the forty-third year.
%Helaman 3:2
\bverse \iffalse And there was no contention among the people in the forty and fourth year; neither was there much contention in the forty and fifth year. \fi
And there were no problems among the people in the forty-fourth year. And there were very few problems in the forty-fifth year.
%Helaman 3:3
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass in the forty and sixth, yea, there was much contention and many dissensions; in the which there were an exceedingly great many who departed out of the land of Zarahemla, and went forth unto the land northward to inherit the land. \fi
And in the forty-sixth year there were many fights and problems; very many people left the land of Zarahemla, and went into the land to the north to live there.
%Helaman 3:4
\bverse \iffalse And they did travel to an exceedingly great distance, insomuch that they came to large bodies of water and many rivers. \fi
And they traveled very far---so far that they came to large bodies of water and many rivers.
%Helaman 3:5
\bverse \iffalse Yea, and even they did spread forth into all parts of the land, into whatever parts it had not been rendered desolate and without timber, because of the many inhabitants who had before inherited the land. \fi
And they spread into all parts of the land, anywhere the land was not ruined and there were still trees. Many parts were empty and had no trees because of the people who had lived there before.
%Helaman 3:6
\bverse \iffalse And now no part of the land was desolate, save it were for timber; but because of the greatness of the destruction of the people who had before inhabited the land it was called desolate. \fi
No part of the land was actually ruined, but in some parts there were no trees. But because the people who lived there before had been terribly destroyed, people said that the land was ruined.
%Helaman 3:7
\bverse \iffalse And there being but little timber upon the face of the land, nevertheless the people who went forth became exceedingly expert in the working of cement; therefore they did build houses of cement, in the which they did dwell. \fi
And since there were only a few trees there, the people who left to live there became experts with cement. And they built houses made of cement instead of wood.
%Helaman 3:8
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that they did multiply and spread, and did go forth from the land southward to the land northward, and did spread insomuch that they began to cover the face of the whole earth, from the sea south to the sea north, from the sea west to the sea east. \fi
And there began to be more and more of them, and they spread out over the land to the south and to the north. They covered every part of the land there, from the sea in the south to the sea in the north, and from the sea in the west to the sea in the east.
%Helaman 3:9
\bverse \iffalse And the people who were in the land northward did dwell in tents, and in houses of cement, and they did suffer whatsoever tree should spring up upon the face of the land that it should grow up, that in time they might have timber to build their houses, yea, their cities, and their temples, and their synagogues, and their sanctuaries, and all manner of their buildings. \fi
And the people who were in the land to the north lived in tents and houses of cement. They left alone any tree that began to grow, so that it could grow up, and someday they could have wood to build their houses, and cities, and temples, and synagogues, and all of their buildings.
%Helaman 3:10
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass as timber was exceedingly scarce in the land northward, they did send forth much by the way of shipping. \fi
And since there were very few trees in the land to the north, they had very much wood shipped to their land.
%Helaman 3:11
\bverse \iffalse And thus they did enable the people in the land northward that they might build many cities, both of wood and of cement. \fi
And this allowed the people in the land to the north to build cities, made of both wood and cement.
%Helaman 3:12
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that there were many of the people of Ammon, who were Lamanites by birth, did also go forth into this land. \fi
And there were many of the people of Ammon, who were Lamanites when they were born, who also went to this land.
%Helaman 3:13
\bverse \iffalse And now there are many records kept of the proceedings of this people, by many of this people, which are particular and very large, concerning them. \fi
And there are many records of the things these people did, written by many different people. These records are carefully kept and very large.
%Helaman 3:14
\bverse \iffalse But behold, a hundredth part of the proceedings of this people, yea, the account of the Lamanites and of the Nephites, and their wars, and contentions, and dissensions, and their preaching, and their prophecies, and their shipping and their building of ships, and their building of temples, and of synagogues and their sanctuaries, and their righteousness, and their wickedness, and their murders, and their robbings, and their plundering, and all manner of abominations and whoredoms, cannot be contained in this work. \fi
But I cannot even write a tiny part of all the things these people did---the records of the Lamanites and Nephites, their wars and problems, their preaching and prophecies, and shipping and shipbuilding, and their building of temples and synagogues, and their righteousness and wickedness, and murders, robberies, plundering, and all kinds of horrible sins, will not fit into this book. 
%Helaman 3:15
\bverse \iffalse But behold, there are many books and many records of every kind, and they have been kept chiefly by the Nephites. \fi
But books and records of every kind have been made. And it is mainly the Nephites that have made them.
%Helaman 3:16
\bverse \iffalse And they have been handed down from one generation to another by the Nephites, even until they have fallen into transgression and have been murdered, plundered, and hunted, and driven forth, and slain, and scattered upon the face of the earth, and mixed with the Lamanites until they are no more called the Nephites, becoming wicked, and wild, and ferocious, yea, even becoming Lamanites. \fi
And these records have been handed down from one generation to the next by the Nephites, until the next generation has fallen into sin, and been murdered, robbed, hunted, driven, killed, and scattered all over the land. They mix with the Lamanites until they are no longer called Nephites, and they become wicked, wild, and ferocious. They become Lamanites.
%Helaman 3:17
\bverse \iffalse And now I return again to mine account; therefore, what I have spoken had passed after there had been great contentions, and disturbances, and wars, and dissensions, among the people of Nephi. \fi
And now I come back to the story I was telling. The things that I have just told you about happened after there had been great wars, disturbances, rebellions, and problems among the people of Nephi.
%Helaman 3:18
\bverse \iffalse The forty and sixth year of the reign of the judges ended; \fi
The forty-sixth year of the judges ended.
%Helaman 3:19
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that there was still great contention in the land, yea, even in the forty and seventh year, and also in the forty and eighth year. \fi

He saw the people living in horrible wickedness. The Gadianton robbers had been made judges. They took power and control over the land. They rejected the commandments of God, and did not even try to do what was right. They did not even try to be fair to the people that they judged.
%Helaman 7:5
\bverse \iffalse Condemning the righteous because of their righteousness; letting the guilty and the wicked go unpunished because of their money; and moreover to be held in office at the head of government, to rule and do according to their wills, that they might get gain and glory of the world, and, moreover, that they might the more easily commit adultery, and steal, and kill, and do according to their own wills-- \fi
They punished the righteous people because they were righteous. They let the guilty and wicked people go unpunished because they had money. They even let them hold positions in the government, so that they could do as they pleased, and get power, riches, and the empty praise of the world.  And since they were in positions of authority, they could easily commit adultery, and steal, and murder, and do as they pleased.
%Helaman 7:6
\bverse \iffalse Now this great iniquity had come upon the Nephites, in the space of not many years; and when Nephi saw it, his heart was swollen with sorrow within his breast; and he did exclaim in the agony of his soul: \fi
It only took a few years for this great evil to come among the Nephites. When Nephi saw it, his heart swelled up with sadness, and he cried out in sorrow:
%Helaman 7:7
\bverse \iffalse Oh, that I could have had my days in the days when my father Nephi first came out of the land of Jerusalem, that I could have joyed with him in the promised land; then were his people easy to be entreated, firm to keep the commandments of God, and slow to be led to do iniquity; and they were quick to hearken unto the words of the Lord-- \fi
``I wish I could have lived in the days when Nephi first left the land of Jerusalem, so that I could have lived joyfully with him in the promised land. His people were patient and humble; they kept God's commandments, and they were not easily convinced to do evil. They were quick to obey the words of the Lord.
%Helaman 7:8
\bverse \iffalse Yea, if my days could have been in those days, then would my soul have had joy in the righteousness of my brethren. \fi
If I could have lived in those days, my soul would have been filled with joy because of the righteousness of my sisters and brothers.

And Nephi said these things while he was on a tower in his garden, which was by the highway that led to the marketplace in the city of Zarahemla. Nephi had bowed himself down on the tower in his garden, and this tower was also near the garden gate that led to the highway.
%Helaman 7:11
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that there were certain men passing by and saw Nephi as he was pouring out his soul unto God upon the tower; and they ran and told the people what they had seen, and the people came together in multitudes that they might know the cause of so great mourning for the wickedness of the people. \fi
Some people passed by and saw Nephi as he was praying earnestly to God on the tower. They ran and told the people what they had seen, and a crowd of people came to hear why Nephi was so sad about the wickedness of the people.
%Helaman 7:12
\bverse \iffalse And now, when Nephi arose he beheld the multitudes of people who had gathered together. \fi
And when Nephi stood up, he saw the crowds of people who had gathered together.
%Helaman 7:13
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that he opened his mouth and said unto them: Behold, why have ye gathered yourselves together? That I may tell you of your iniquities? \fi
And he opened his mouth and said to them: ``Why have you gathered here? So that I can tell you about your sins?
%Helaman 7:14
\bverse \iffalse Yea, because I have got upon my tower that I might pour out my soul unto my God, because of the exceeding sorrow of my heart, which is because of your iniquities! \fi
It is  because I got on top of my tower to pour out my soul to my God, because of the great sadness in my heart, which has come because of your evil sins!
%Helaman 7:15
\bverse \iffalse And because of my mourning and lamentation ye have gathered yourselves together, and do marvel; yea, and ye have great need to marvel; yea, ye ought to marvel because ye are given away that the devil has got so great hold upon your hearts. \fi
And because of my sadness and crying you have gathered together, and you are amazed. You should be amazed; you should be amazed that the devil has gotten such a firm grip on your hearts.

How could you have let yourselves give in to the temptations of the one who is trying to throw you down into neverending misery and gloom?
%Helaman 7:17
\bverse \iffalse O repent ye, repent ye! Why will ye die? Turn ye, turn ye unto the Lord your God. Why has he forsaken you? \fi
Repent, repent! Why do you want to die? Turn right now to the Lord your God! Why has God left you?
%Helaman 7:18
\bverse \iffalse It is because you have hardened your hearts; yea, ye will not hearken unto the voice of the good shepherd; yea, ye have provoked him to anger against you. \fi
It is because you have hardened your hearts. You will not listen to the good shepherd, and you have made him angry at you.

If you do not repent, instead of gathering you, he will scatter you, and you will become meat for dogs and wild animals.

And ye have set your hearts upon the riches and the vain things of this world, for the which ye do murder, and plunder, and steal, and bear false witness against your neighbor, and do all manner of iniquity. \fi
You have forgotten your God so that you can get power and money, and gold and silver, and get other people to praise you. You have your hearts set on the riches and empty things of this world. To get these things you murder, plunder, steal, and lie about your neighbor, and do all sorts of evil.
%Helaman 7:22
\bverse \iffalse And for this cause wo shall come unto you except ye shall repent. For if ye will not repent, behold, this great city, and also all those great cities which are round about, which are in the land of our possession, shall be taken away that ye shall have no place in them; for behold, the Lord will not grant unto you strength, as he has hitherto done, to withstand against your enemies. \fi
And because of this, you will be doomed unless you repent. If you do not repent, this great city, and all the great cities around it that are here in our lands, will be taken away. There will be no place for you in them. The Lord will not give you strength to fight off your enemies, as he has before.
%Helaman 7:23
\bverse \iffalse For behold, thus saith the Lord: I will not show unto the wicked of my strength, to one more than the other, save it be unto those that repent of their sins, and hearken unto my words.  Now therefore, I would that ye should behold, my brethren, that it shall be better for the Lamanites than for you except ye shall repent. \fi
This is what the Lord says: \lq When there are two wicked people, I will not give more help to one of them than I give to the other. I give my help to the people who repent of their sins, and listen to my words.\rq{} I want you to realize, my sisters and brothers, that the Lamanites will be better off than you if you do not repent.
%Helaman 7:24
\bverse \iffalse For behold, they are more righteous than you, for they have not sinned against that great knowledge which ye have received; therefore the Lord will be merciful unto them; yea, he will lengthen out their days and increase their seed, even when thou shalt be utterly destroyed except thou shalt repent. \fi

How terrible it will be for you because of the great and horrible evil that has come among you. You have joined with that evil---the secret gang that was started by Gadianton!

How terrible it will be for you because of the pride that you have allowed to come into your hearts. Your hearts have lifted you up, above what is right, because of your wealth and money!

How terrible it will be for you because of your wickedness and evil!
%Helaman 7:28
\bverse \iffalse And except ye repent ye shall perish; yea, even your lands shall be taken from you, and ye shall be destroyed from off the face of the earth. \fi
And if you do not repent, you will die. Your lands will be taken from you, and you will be completely destroyed.
%Helaman 7:29
\bverse \iffalse Behold now, I do not say that these things shall be, of myself, because it is not of myself that I know these things; but behold, I know that these things are true because the Lord God has made them known unto me, therefore I testify that they shall be. \fi
I am not making this up by myself; I did not find these things out by myself. I know that these things are true because the Lord God has told them to me; and this is how I know that they will happen.
%Chapter 8
\bchapter
%Helaman 8:1
\bverse \iffalse And now it came to pass that when Nephi had said these words, behold, there were men who were judges, who also belonged to the secret band of Gadianton, and they were angry, and they cried out against him, saying unto the people: Why do ye not seize upon this man and bring him forth, that he may be condemned according to the crime which he has done? \fi
And when Nephi said these words some men in the crowd who were judges, who were also members of Gadianton's secret gang, became angry. They cried out to the people: ``Why don't you grab this man and bring him to be tried, so that he can be punished for the crimes that he has committed?
%Helaman 8:2
\bverse \iffalse Why seest thou this man, and hearest him revile against this people and against our law? \fi
Why are you just standing there watching him, listening to him say evil things against this people and against our law?''
%Helaman 8:3
\bverse \iffalse For behold, Nephi had spoken unto them concerning the corruptness of their law; yea, many things did Nephi speak which cannot be written; and nothing did he speak which was contrary to the commandments of God. \fi
They said this because Nephi had told them that their laws were dishonest and evil. And Nephi said many other things that cannot be written, but nothing he said was against the commandments of God.
%Helaman 8:4
\bverse \iffalse And those judges were angry with him because he spake plainly unto them concerning their secret works of darkness; nevertheless, they durst not lay their own hands upon him, for they feared the people lest they should cry out against them. \fi
And those judges were angry with him, because he was not afraid to speak about their secret and dark deeds. But they did not dare to put their own hands on him; they were afraid that this would upset the people, and make the people cry out against them.
%Helaman 8:5
\bverse \iffalse Therefore they did cry unto the people, saying: Why do you suffer this man to revile against us? For behold he doth condemn all this people, even unto destruction; yea, and also that these our great cities shall be taken from us, that we shall have no place in them. \fi
This is the reason that the judges said to the people: ``Why are you letting this man say these terrible things about us? He says that all our people will be punished and destroyed! He says that our great cities will be taken from us, and there will be no place for us in them.
%Helaman 8:6
\bverse \iffalse And now we know that this is impossible, for behold, we are powerful, and our cities great, therefore our enemies can have no power over us. \fi
We know that this is impossible, because we are powerful, and our cities are great. Our enemies cannot overpower us.''
%Helaman 8:7
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that thus they did stir up the people to anger against Nephi, and raised contentions among them; for there were some who did cry out: Let this man alone, for he is a good man, and those things which he saith will surely come to pass except we repent; \fi
They started an argument among the people, and got som of them to be angry at Nephi. Some of the people said: ``Leave this man alone! He is a good man, and what he says will surely happen unless we repent.
%Helaman 8:8
\bverse \iffalse Yea, behold, all the judgments will come upon us which he has testified unto us; for we know that he has testified aright unto us concerning our iniquities. And behold they are many, and he knoweth as well all things which shall befall us as he knoweth of our iniquities; \fi
All those punishments that he spoke about will happen to us. We know that he is telling the truth about our sins. We have committed many sins. And he knows what will happen to us just like he knows about our sins.
%Helaman 8:9
\bverse \iffalse Yea, and behold, if he had not been a prophet he could not have testified concerning those things. \fi
He would not be able to testify to us about these things if he were not a prophet.''
%Helaman 8:10
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that those people who sought to destroy Nephi were compelled because of their fear, that they did not lay their hands on him; therefore he began again to speak unto them, seeing that he had gained favor in the eyes of some, insomuch that the remainder of them did fear. \fi
And the people who wanted to destroy Nephi were afraid, so they did not take hold of him and try to take him away. Nephi began to speak to them again, because he saw that some of the people supported him, and the rest of them were afraid.
%Helaman 8:11
\bverse \iffalse Therefore he was constrained to speak more unto them saying: Behold, my brethren, have ye not read that God gave power unto one man, even Moses, to smite upon the waters of the Red Sea, and they parted hither and thither, insomuch that the Israelites, who were our fathers, came through upon dry ground, and the waters closed upon the armies of the Egyptians and swallowed them up? \fi
He said: ``My sisters and brothers, God gave power to a single person, Moses, to cause the waters of the Red Sea to divide. And our ancestors, the Israelites, walked through on dry ground. But the waters closed on the Egyptian armies and swallowed them up. Haven't you read this before?
%Helaman 8:12
\bverse \iffalse And now behold, if God gave unto this man such power, then why should ye dispute among yourselves, and say that he hath given unto me no power whereby I may know concerning the judgments that shall come upon you except ye repent? \fi
And if God gave Moses so much power, why are some of you arguing, and saying that God has not given me power to know about the punishments that are waiting for you unless you repent?
%Helaman 8:13
\bverse \iffalse But, behold, ye not only deny my words, but ye also deny all the words which have been spoken by our fathers, and also the words which were spoken by this man, Moses, who had such great power given unto him, yea, the words which he hath spoken concerning the coming of the Messiah. \fi
You are not only rejecting my words. You are rejecting all the words that our ancestors have spoken, and all the words of Moses, the one who had so much power given to him. You are also rejecting the words that Moses said about the coming of the Messiah.
%Helaman 8:14
\bverse \iffalse Yea, did he not bear record that the Son of God should come?  And as he lifted up the brazen serpent in the wilderness, even so shall he be lifted up who should come. \fi
Don't you remember that he bore testimony that the Son of God would come? And just as Moses lifted up the brass serpent in the wilderness, the One who Moses said would come will also be lifted up.
%Helaman 8:15
\bverse \iffalse And as many as should look upon that serpent should live, even so as many as should look upon the Son of God with faith, having a contrite spirit, might live, even unto that life which is eternal. \fi
And just as anyone who looked at the serpent lived, anyone who looks up to the Son of God with faith, who wants to repent, can also live. And they will have eternal life.
%Helaman 8:16
\bverse \iffalse And now behold, Moses did not only testify of these things, but also all the holy prophets, from his days even to the days of Abraham. \fi
Moses was not the only one who testified about these things. All of the holy prophets, from the time when Zipporah and Moses lived to the time when Sarah and Abraham lived, have also testified about them.
%Helaman 8:17
\bverse \iffalse Yea, and behold, Abraham saw of his coming, and was filled with gladness and did rejoice. \fi
Abraham also saw that the Son of God would come, and this filled him with gladness and joy.
%Helaman 8:18
\bverse \iffalse Yea, and behold I say unto you, that Abraham not only knew of these things, but there were many before the days of Abraham who were called by the order of God; yea, even after the order of his Son; and this that it should be shown unto the people, a great many thousand years before his coming, that even redemption should come unto them. \fi
And Abraham was not the only one who knew about these things. There were many people even before Abraham lived who were called by the order of God's Son. These people were called so that people who lived even many thousands of years before the coming of the Son of God could also be redeemed.
%Helaman 8:19
\bverse \iffalse And now I would that ye should know, that even since the days of Abraham there have been many prophets that have testified these things; yea, behold, the prophet Zenos did testify boldly; for the which he was slain. \fi
And I want you to know, that even since the time when Sarah and Abraham lived, there have been many prophets who testified that these things are true. The prophet Zenos testified boldly that they were true, and he was killed because he testified.
%Helaman 8:20
\bverse \iffalse And behold, also Zenock, and also Ezias, and also Isaiah, and Jeremiah, (Jeremiah being that same prophet who testified of the destruction of Jerusalem) and now we know that Jerusalem was destroyed according to the words of Jeremiah. O then why not the Son of God come, according to his prophecy? \fi
And Zenock, Ezias, Isaiah, and Jeremiah have also testified that they are true. Jeremiah was the prophet who testified that Jerusalem would be destroyed, and we know that Jerusalem was destroyed, just as Jeremiah prophesied. So why shouldn't the Son of God also come, just as Jeremiah prophesied?
%Helaman 8:21
\bverse \iffalse And now will you dispute that Jerusalem was destroyed? Will ye say that the sons of Zedekiah were not slain, all except it were Mulek? Yea, and do ye not behold that the seed of Zedekiah are with us, and they were driven out of the land of Jerusalem?  But behold, this is not all-- \fi
Are you going to argue that Jerusalem was not destroyed? Are you going to say that all the sons of Zedekiah, besides Mulek, were not killed? Can't you see that the descendants of Zedekiah are here with us, because they were driven out of the land of Jerusalem? But this is not all.
%Helaman 8:22
\bverse \iffalse Our father Lehi was driven out of Jerusalem because he testified of these things. Nephi also testified of these things, and also almost all of our fathers, even down to this time; yea, they have testified of the coming of Christ, and have looked forward, and have rejoiced in his day which is to come. \fi
Our mother and father, Sariah and Lehi, were driven out of Jerusalem, because Lehi testified that these things are true. And Nephi testified, and almost all of our ancestors down to this time have testified, that Christ will come. They have looked forward to that day, and they have been filled with joy.
%Helaman 8:23
\bverse \iffalse And behold, he is God, and he is with them, and he did manifest himself unto them, that they were redeemed by him; and they gave unto him glory, because of that which is to come. \fi
He is God, and he is with them. He showed himself to them, and they were redeemed by him. They gave him glory, because of what will someday come.
%Helaman 8:24
\bverse \iffalse And now, seeing ye know these things and cannot deny them except ye shall lie, therefore in this ye have sinned, for ye have rejected all these things, notwithstanding so many evidences which ye have received; yea, even ye have received all things, both things in heaven, and all things which are in the earth, as a witness that they are true. \fi
You know these things. If you deny it, you are lying. And this is the sin you have committed. You have rejected all these things, even though you have so much evidence that they are true. Heavenly things and all things that are on the earth have witnessed to you that they are true.
%Helaman 8:25
\bverse \iffalse But behold, ye have rejected the truth, and rebelled against your holy God; and even at this time, instead of laying up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where nothing doth corrupt, and where nothing can come which is unclean, ye are heaping up for yourselves wrath against the day of judgment. \fi
But you have rejected the truth, and rebelled against your holy God. And even right now, instead of storing your treasure in heaven, where it cannot be destroyed and where nothing dirty can come, you are heaping up God's anger against you on the day of judgment.
%Helaman 8:26
\bverse \iffalse Yea, even at this time ye are ripening, because of your murders and your fornication and wickedness, for everlasting destruction; yea, and except ye repent it will come unto you soon. \fi
You are going to be destroyed because of your murders, and wickedness, and your sexual sins. If you do not repent, you will be destroyed soon.
%Helaman 8:27
\bverse \iffalse Yea, behold it is now even at your doors; yea, go ye in unto the judgment-seat, and search; and behold, your judge is murdered, and he lieth in his blood; and he hath been murdered by his brother, who seeketh to sit in the judgment-seat. \fi
Your destruction is already here: Go to the judgment-seat and look. You will find your judge murdered, lying in his own blood. He has been murdered by his brother, who is trying to take over the judgment-seat.
%Helaman 8:28
\bverse \iffalse And behold, they both belong to your secret band, whose author is Gadianton and the evil one who seeketh to destroy the souls of men. \fi
Both of them belong to your secret gang, which was started by Gadianton and the devil, who wants to destroy the souls of humankind.''

%Helaman 9:1

And when Nephi had said finished speaking, some men in the crowd ran to the judgment-seat. There were five of them, and they said to each other:
%Helaman 9:2
\bverse \iffalse Behold, now we will know of a surety whether this man be a prophet and God hath commanded him to prophesy such marvelous things unto us. Behold, we do not believe that he hath; yea, we do not believe that he is a prophet; nevertheless, if this thing which he has said concerning the chief judge be true, that he be dead, then will we believe that the other words which he has spoken are true. \fi
``Now we will find out for sure whether this man is a prophet, and whether God has commanded him to prophesy these amazing things to us. We do not believe that God has, and we do not believe that he is a prophet. But, if what he has said about the chief judge really is true, and he is dead, then we will believe the rest of what he has said.''

And when they saw this they were so amazed that they fell to the ground, because they had not believed Nephi when he told them.

But now that they had seen, they believed Nephi, and they became very afraid that the people would be punished as Nephi had said. And they trembled and fell to the ground.

%Helaman 9:8
\bverse \iffalse And now behold, the people knew nothing concerning the multitude who had gathered together at the garden of Nephi; therefore they said among themselves: These men are they who have murdered the judge, and God has smitten them that they could not flee from us. \fi
The people who gathered did not know anything about the crowd that had gathered at Nephi's garden. So they said to each other: ``These are the ones who murdered the chief judge. God has struck them so that they could not run away from us!''
%Helaman 9:9

We do not know who murdered this man. All we know is that we ran and did what you asked us to do, and he was dead, just as Nephi said.''
%Helaman 9:16
\bverse \iffalse And now it came to pass that the judges did expound the matter unto the people, and did cry out against Nephi, saying: Behold, we know that this Nephi must have agreed with some one to slay the judge, and then he might declare it unto us, that he might convert us unto his faith, that he might raise himself to be a great man, chosen of God, and a prophet. \fi
And the judges explained what had happened to the people.

And the eighty-first year of the judges ended.
%Helaman 11:36

\bchapter
%Helaman 12:1
\bverse \iffalse And thus we can behold how false, and also the unsteadiness of the hearts of the children of men; yea, we can see that the Lord in his great infinite goodness doth bless and prosper those who put their trust in him. \fi
And so we see how false and unsteady the hearts of humans are. We can see that the Lord, because his goodness is neverending, blesses and gives strength to those who trust him.
%Helaman 12:2
\bverse \iffalse Yea, and we may see at the very time when he doth prosper his people, yea, in the increase of their fields, their flocks and their herds, and in gold, and in silver, and in all manner of precious things of every kind and art; sparing their lives, and delivering them out of the hands of their enemies; softening the hearts of their enemies that they should not declare wars against them; yea, and in fine, doing all things for the welfare and happiness of his people; yea, then is the time that they do harden their hearts, and do forget the Lord their God, and do trample under their feet the Holy One--yea, and this because of their ease, and their exceedingly great prosperity. \fi
And we see that he blesses his people, and their fields, and their flocks and herds. He blesses them with gold and silver, and precious things of every kind. He spares their lives, and saves them from their enemies. He softens the hearts of his people's enemies so that they do not declare war against them. And in short, the Lord does everything for the happiness and success of his people. And at the very time when he does all of these things, they harden their hearts and forget the Lord their God. They trample the Lord under their feet because their lives are easy, and they are successful, and they have far more than they need.
%Helaman 12:3
\bverse \iffalse And thus we see that except the Lord doth chasten his people with many afflictions, yea, except he doth visit them with death and with terror, and with famine and with all manner of pestilence, they will not remember him. \fi
We see that they will not remember the Lord, unless the Lord corrects them and punishes them with misfortune and problems, and brings death, terror, famine, and disease among them.
%Helaman 12:4
\bverse \iffalse O how foolish, and how vain, and how evil, and devilish, and how quick to do iniquity, and how slow to do good, are the children of men; yea, how quick to hearken unto the words of the evil one, and to set their hearts upon the vain things of the world! \fi
How foolish and proud, how evil and devilish, how quick to sin and how slow to do good is humankind! How quick they are to listen to the words of the devil, and set their hearts on the empty things of the world!
%Helaman 12:5
\bverse \iffalse Yea, how quick to be lifted up in pride; yea, how quick to boast, and do all manner of that which is iniquity; and how slow are they to remember the Lord their God, and to give ear unto his counsels, yea, how slow to walk in wisdom's paths! \fi
How quick to be proud, and to boast, and to do all sorts of evil! How slow they are to remember the Lord their God and listen to his advice! How slow they are to do what is wise!
%Helaman 12:6
\bverse \iffalse Behold, they do not desire that the Lord their God, who hath created them, should rule and reign over them; notwithstanding his great goodness and his mercy towards them, they do set at naught his counsels, and they will not that he should be their guide. \fi
Look and see: they do not want the Lord their God, who created them, to rule over them. Even though he is very good to them, and very merciful, they reject his advice and wisdom, and do not want him to be their guide.
%Helaman 12:7
\bverse \iffalse O how great is the nothingness of the children of men; yea, even they are less than the dust of the earth. \fi
But humankind is nothing; they are even less than the dust of the earth.
%Helaman 12:8
\bverse \iffalse For behold, the dust of the earth moveth hither and thither, to the dividing asunder, at the command of our great and everlasting God. \fi
For, you see, the dust of the earth moves to and fro and is divided at the command of our great and everlasting God.
%Helaman 12:9

By the power of God's voice the entire earth shakes.
%Helaman 12:12
\bverse \iffalse Yea, by the power of his voice, do the foundations rock, even to the very center. \fi
By the power of God's voice the foundations of the earth rock, even to very center.
%Helaman 12:13
\bverse \iffalse Yea, and if he say unto the earth--Move--it is moved. \fi
If God says to the earth, ``Move,'' it will move.
%Helaman 12:14
\bverse \iffalse Yea, if he say unto the earth--Thou shalt go back, that it lengthen out the day for many hours--it is done; \fi
If God says to the earth, ``You shall go back, so that the day becomes many hours longer,'' it is done.
%Helaman 12:15
\bverse \iffalse And thus, according to his word the earth goeth back, and it appeareth unto man that the sun standeth still; yea, and behold, this is so; for surely it is the earth that moveth and not the sun. \fi
And so, according to God's word, the earth goes back and it appears to humankind that the sun is standing still. And this is true, because it is surely the earth that moves, not the sun.
%Helaman 12:16
\bverse \iffalse And behold, also, if he say unto the waters of the great deep--Be thou dried up--it is done. \fi
And if God says to the waters in the depths of the sea, ``Dry up,'' it is done.
%Helaman 12:17
\bverse \iffalse Behold, if he say unto this mountain--Be thou raised up, and come over and fall upon that city, that it be buried up--behold it is done. \fi
If God says to the mountains, ``Rise from the earth, and come and fall on that city, so that it is buried up,'' it is done.
%Helaman 12:18
\bverse \iffalse And behold, if a man hide up a treasure in the earth, and the Lord shall say--Let it be accursed, because of the iniquity of him who hath hid it up--behold, it shall be accursed. \fi
And if a person buries a treasure to hide it, and the Lord says, ``Let that treasure be cursed, because the person who buried it is evil,'' that treasure is cursed.
%Helaman 12:19
\bverse \iffalse And if the Lord shall say--Be thou accursed, that no man shall find thee from this time henceforth and forever--behold, no man getteth it henceforth and forever. \fi
And if the Lord says to that treasure, ``You are cursed, so that no one will find you ever again,'' no one will ever again be able to get that treasure.
%Helaman 12:20
\bverse \iffalse And behold, if the Lord shall say unto a man--Because of thine iniquities, thou shalt be accursed forever--it shall be done. \fi
And if the Lord says to a person, ``Because of your sins, you will be cursed forever,'' it is done.
%Helaman 12:21
\bverse \iffalse And if the Lord shall say--Because of thine iniquities thou shalt be cut off from my presence--he will cause that it shall be so. \fi
And if the Lord says, ``Because of your sins you cannot be in my presence,'' he will cause it to be so.
%Helaman 12:22
\bverse \iffalse And wo unto him to whom he shall say this, for it shall be unto him that will do iniquity, and he cannot be saved; therefore, for this cause, that men might be saved, hath repentance been declared. \fi
How terrible it will be for the one to whom the Lord says this. It will happen to the person who does evil, and they cannot be saved. And humankind has been told about repentance so that they can be saved.
%Helaman 12:23
\bverse \iffalse Therefore, blessed are they who will repent and hearken unto the voice of the Lord their God; for these are they that shall be saved. \fi
And anyone who wants to repent and listen to the voice of the Lord their God will be blessed. These are the ones who will be saved.
%Helaman 12:24
\bverse \iffalse And may God grant, in his great fulness, that men might be brought unto repentance and good works, that they might be restored unto grace for grace, according to their works. \fi
And may God, in God's great fullness, allow humankind to come and repent and do what is right, and be given one blessing after another according to their works.
%Helaman 12:25
\bverse \iffalse And I would that all men might be saved. But we read that in the great and last day there are some who shall be cast out, yea, who shall be cast off from the presence of the Lord; \fi
I wish that all humankind could be saved. But we read that on the great and last day there are some who will be thrown out of the Lord's presence.
%Helaman 12:26
\bverse \iffalse Yea, who shall be consigned to a state of endless misery, fulfilling the words which say: They that have done good shall have everlasting life; and they that have done evil shall have everlasting damnation. And thus it is. Amen. \fi
It will be their fate to live in endless misery, showing that these words are true: ``Those who have done good will have life forever. And those who have done evil will be guilty forever.'' And so it is. Amen.

And in this year, there was a Lamanite named Samuel who came into the land of Zarahemla and began to preach. He preached about repentance for many days. But the people threw him out, and he was about to return to his own land.

\bverse \iffalse But behold, the voice of the Lord came unto him, that he should return again, and prophesy unto the people whatsoever things should come into his heart. \fi
But the voice of the Lord came to him, and told him to go back to the people and prophesy about anything that came into his heart.
%Helaman 13:4

And the people would not allow him to enter the city. So he went and climbed on top of the wall around the city. He stretched out his hand and cried out with a loud voice, and prophesied about the things that the Lord put into his heart.
%Helaman 13:5
\bverse \iffalse And he said unto them: Behold, I, Samuel, a Lamanite, do speak the words of the Lord which he doth put into my heart; and behold he hath put it into my heart to say unto this people that the sword of justice hangeth over this people; and four hundred years pass not away save the sword of justice falleth upon this people. \fi
He said to them: ``I, Samuel, a Lamanite, speak the words that the Lord puts into my heart. And he has put it into my heart to tell this people that the sword of justice is hanging over them. And before four hundred years have gone by, this sword will fall on them.

An angel from the Lord has declared this to me, and the things he said filled me with gladness. I was sent to you to declare this good news to you so that you could also be filled with joy, but you rejected me.

How terrible it will be for this great city of Zarahemla! This city has been spared because of the righteous people living in it. But how terrible it will be for this city, for I see that most of the people in this great city will harden their hearts and reject me,\rq{} says the Lord.
%Helaman 13:13

I want them to think of me and my will when they hide away their treasures,\rq{} says the Lord. \lq The people who do not think of me when they hide their treasures are cursed; only the righteous think of me and my will when they hide their treasures. If a person does not think of me and my will when they hide away their treasure, they are cursed, and so is the treasure. No one will find that treasure again, because the land is cursed.
%Helaman 13:20
\bverse \iffalse And the day shall come that they shall hide up their treasures, because they have set their hearts upon riches; and because they have set their hearts upon their riches, and will hide up their treasures when they shall flee before their enemies; because they will not hide them up unto me, cursed be they and also their treasures; and in that day shall they be smitten, saith the Lord. \fi
The time will come when they hide their treasures because riches are the most important thing to them. They will care about money more than anything else, and they will try to hide their treasures when they run from their enemies.

Look, you people of this great city, and listen to my words. Listen to what the Lord is saying.

You do not remember the Lord your God or the things that he has blessed you with. You always remember your money, but you do not remember to thank the Lord your God. Your hearts are not full of love for the Lord; your hearts are full of pride, and you boast and brag. You envy each other and argue with each other. You hate one another; you bully and hurt each other, and murder, and commit all kinds of sins.
%Helaman 13:23
\bverse \iffalse For this cause hath the Lord God caused that a curse should come upon the land, and also upon your riches, and this because of your iniquities. \fi

\bverse \iffalse And now when ye talk, ye say: If our days had been in the days of our fathers of old, we would not have slain the prophets; we would not have stoned them, and cast them out. \fi
But when you talk, you say: \lq If we had lived when our ancestors lived, we would not have killed the prophets. We would not have stoned them or thrown them out.\rq
%Helaman 13:26
\bverse \iffalse Behold ye are worse than they; for as the Lord liveth, if a prophet come among you and declareth unto you the word of the Lord, which testifieth of your sins and iniquities, ye are angry with him, and cast him out and seek all manner of ways to destroy him; yea, you will say that he is a false prophet, and that he is a sinner, and of the devil, because he testifieth that your deeds are evil. \fi
But you are even worse than they were! As surely as the Lord lives, when prophets come to you, declaring the word of the Lord and telling you about your sins and evil deeds, you are angry, you try to throw them out, and you try to find a way to destroy them. You say that they are false prophets and sinners, and that the devil sent them---all because they tell you that the way you are living is evil.
%Helaman 13:27
\bverse \iffalse But behold, if a man shall come among you and shall say: Do this, and there is no iniquity; do that and ye shall not suffer; yea, he will say: Walk after the pride of your own hearts; yea, walk after the pride of your eyes, and do whatsoever your heart desireth--and if a man shall come among you and say this, ye will receive him, and say that he is a prophet. \fi
But if someone comes to you and says: \lq Do whatever you want; there is nothing bad about it. You can do what you like; you won't be punished for it! Be proud, and show that you are proud. Do what you feel like doing.\rq{} If someone comes to you and says these kinds of things, you will welcome them and say that they are a prophet.

\bverse \iffalse Yea, ye will lift him up, and ye will give unto him of your substance; ye will give unto him of your gold, and of your silver, and ye will clothe him with costly apparel; and because he speaketh flattering words unto you, and he saith that all is well, then ye will not find fault with him. \fi
You will make that person a leader, and support them with your own possessions. You will give them gold, and silver, and very expensive clothes. And because they flatter you, and say that everything is well, you will say that they are innocent.
%Helaman 13:29
\bverse \iffalse O ye wicked and ye perverse generation; ye hardened and ye stiffnecked people, how long will ye suppose that the Lord will suffer you? Yea, how long will ye suffer yourselves to be led by foolish and blind guides? Yea, how long will ye choose darkness rather than light? \fi

We are surrounded by demons, the angels of the one who wants to destroy our souls. Our wickedness has been very great. O Lord, will you please stop being angry with us?\rq{} These are the things you will say when those days come.
%Helaman 13:38
\bverse \iffalse But behold, your days of probation are past; ye have procrastinated the day of your salvation until it is everlastingly too late, and your destruction is made sure; yea, for ye have sought all the days of your lives for that which ye could not obtain; and ye have sought for happiness in doing iniquity, which thing is contrary to the nature of that righteousness which is in our great and Eternal Head. \fi
But the days for you to be tested have gone by. You have waited to repent until it is already too late, and you will be destroyed.

Because of the death of Jesus Christ the dead will be resurrected, and all humankind are saved from the first death. The first death is the spiritual death that happens to all humankind.

Christ's resurrection makes it possible to repent, so that anyone who repents will not be cut down and thrown into the fires of hell.

%Helaman 14:20
\bverse \iffalse But behold, as I said unto you concerning another sign, a sign of his death, behold, in that day that he shall suffer death the sun shall be darkened and refuse to give his light unto you; and also the moon and the stars; and there shall be no light upon the face of this land, even from the time that he shall suffer death, for the space of three days, to the time that he shall rise again from the dead. \fi
Now I will tell you about the sign of his death. On the day that he dies the sun will be darkened, and will not shine. The moon and the stars will also be darkened. There will be no light anywhere in this land for three days, from the time that he dies until the time that he rises from the dead.

The angel said that these things will happen while the thunder, lightning, and storms last, and that darkness will cover the whole land for three days.
%Helaman 14:28
\bverse \iffalse And the angel said unto me that many shall see greater things than these, to the intent that they might believe that these signs and these wonders should come to pass upon all the face of this land, to the intent that there should be no cause for unbelief among the children of men-- \fi
And the angel said to me that many people will see things even greater than these things, so that they might believe these signs and miracles that will happen all over the land, so that there is no reason for anyone to doubt or disbelieve.
%Helaman 14:29
\bverse \iffalse And this to the intent that whosoever will believe might be saved, and that whosoever will not believe, a righteous judgment might come upon them; and also if they are condemned they bring upon themselves their own condemnation. \fi
So anyone who wants to believe will be saved, and anyone who does not want to believe will be judged righteously. And if they are found guilty, it will be because of their own choices.
%Helaman 14:30
\bverse \iffalse And now remember, remember, my brethren, that whosoever perisheth, perisheth unto himself; and whosoever doeth iniquity, doeth it unto himself; for behold, ye are free; ye are permitted to act for yourselves; for behold, God hath given unto you a knowledge and he hath made you free. \fi
Remember! Remember, my sisters and brothers, that everyone who dies spiritually, chooses this for themselves. And everyone who does evil, chooses this for themselves. You are free---free to choose for yourselves and act. God has given you understanding, and has given you power to choose.
%Helaman 14:31
\bverse \iffalse He hath given unto you that ye might know good from evil, and he hath given unto you that ye might choose life or death; and ye can do good and be restored unto that which is good, or have that which is good restored unto you; or ye can do evil, and have that which is evil restored unto you. \fi
God has given you what you need to know the difference between good and evil. God gives you a choice, and you can choose between life and death. You can do what is right and good, and those good things will return to you. Or you can do evil, and have those evil things return to you.

If you do not repent, you women will have reason to be full of sadness when your breasts fill with milk for your child. You will try to run away, but there will be no place to hide or take cover. And how terrible it will be for the women who are pregnant; they will be too heavy, and they will not be able to run away. So they will be trampled and left to die.
%Helaman 15:3
\bverse \iffalse Yea, wo unto this people who are called the people of Nephi except they shall repent, when they shall see all these signs and wonders which shall be showed unto them; for behold, they have been a chosen people of the Lord; yea, the people of Nephi hath he loved, and also hath he chastened them; yea, in the days of their iniquities hath he chastened them because he loveth them. \fi

But we know that this is an evil tradition that has been told to us by our ancestors, to get us to believe in some great and miraculous that is supposed to happen---not among us, but in some land that is far away, that we have never been to.
