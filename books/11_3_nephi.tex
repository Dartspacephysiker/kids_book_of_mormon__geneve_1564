\bverse \iffalse And now it came to pass that in the sixteenth year from the coming of Christ, Lachoneus, the governor of the land, received an epistle from the leader and the governor of this band of robbers; and these were the words which were written, saying: \fi
And sixteen years after Christ had come, Lachoneus, who was the governor of the land, got a letter from the leader and governor of the gang of robbers. This is what the letter said:
%3 Nephi 3:2
\bverse \iffalse Lachoneus, most noble and chief governor of the land, behold, I write this epistle unto you, and do give unto you exceedingly great praise because of your firmness, and also the firmness of your people, in maintaining that which ye suppose to be your right and liberty; yea, ye do stand well, as if ye were supported by the hand of a god, in the defence of your liberty, and your property, and your country, or that which ye do call so. \fi
``Lachoneus, great and chief governor of the land, I am writing to praise you greatly because you and your people have been so strong in defending what you call your rights and your freedom. You are very good fighters; it almost seems like there is some god who is helping you to defend what you call your freedom, your property, and your country.
%3 Nephi 3:3
\bverse \iffalse And it seemeth a pity unto me, most noble Lachoneus, that ye should be so foolish and vain as to suppose that ye can stand against so many brave men who are at my command, who do now at this time stand in their arms, and do await with great anxiety for the word--Go down upon the Nephites and destroy them. \fi
But I think it is a pity, most noble Lachoneus, that you are so foolish to think that you can defend yourselves against the many brave men that I command. Even right now they are standing with their weapons, and they are waiting impatiently for me to give the command---Go down and attack the Nephites, and destroy them.
%3 Nephi 3:4
\bverse \iffalse And I, knowing of their unconquerable spirit, having proved them in the field of battle, and knowing of their everlasting hatred towards you because of the many wrongs which ye have done unto them, therefore if they should come down against you they would visit you with utter destruction. \fi
I have tested them in battle, and I know that they cannot be conquered. I know that they hate you with a hate that will never go away, because of the many horrible things you have done to them. And if they came down to attack you, they would completely destroy you.
%3 Nephi 3:5
\bverse \iffalse Therefore I have written this epistle, sealing it with mine own hand, feeling for your welfare, because of your firmness in that which ye believe to be right, and your noble spirit in the field of battle. \fi
This is why I am writing this letter, and signing with my own hand. I feel sorry for you, because you fight so bravely to defend what you believe is right.
%3 Nephi 3:6
\bverse \iffalse Therefore I write unto you, desiring that ye would yield up unto this my people, your cities, your lands, and your possessions, rather than that they should visit you with the sword and that destruction should come upon you. \fi
I am writing to you to tell you to give up. I would rather have you give up yourselves, your cities, your lands, and the things you own to my people, than have them come and completely destroy you.
%3 Nephi 3:7
\bverse \iffalse Or in other words, yield yourselves up unto us, and unite with us and become acquainted with our secret works, and become our brethren that ye may be like unto us--not our slaves, but our brethren and partners of all our substance. \fi
In other words, stop fighting with us. Join us and come and learn about our secrets. Become our friends and family, and be like us---not our slaves, but our family and friends in all the things that we have and do.
%3 Nephi 3:8
\bverse \iffalse And behold, I swear unto you, if ye will do this, with an oath, ye shall not be destroyed; but if ye will not do this, I swear unto you with an oath, that on the morrow month I will command that my armies shall come down against you, and they shall not stay their hand and shall spare not, but shall slay you, and shall let fall the sword upon you even until ye shall become extinct. \fi
And I swear to you with a promise, that if you will do this you will not be destroyed.

%3 Nephi 3:9

I am Giddianhi. \fi
I write this letter to you, Lachoneus, and I hope that you will give up your lands and the things you own without a fight, so that my people can take back their rights and the government. My people have left your people because you have so wickedly taken their right to govern the people from them. And if you do not do this, I will take revenge. I am Giddianhi.''
%3 Nephi 3:11
\bverse \iffalse And now it came to pass when Lachoneus received this epistle he was exceedingly astonished, because of the boldness of Giddianhi demanding the possession of the land of the Nephites, and also of threatening the people and avenging the wrongs of those that had received no wrong, save it were they had wronged themselves by dissenting away unto those wicked and abominable robbers. \fi
When Lachoneus got this letter he was very surprised that Giddianhi had been so bold, and demanded that they give up the land of the Nephites. He was amazed that he threatened them and said that he would take revenge for his people, who Giddianhi said had been harmed and mistreated by the Nephites. Lachoneus knew that they had caused harm to themselves by leaving the Nephites and joining that gang of evil robbers.
%3 Nephi 3:12
\bverse \iffalse Now behold, this Lachoneus, the governor, was a just man, and could not be frightened by the demands and the threatenings of a robber; therefore he did not hearken to the epistle of Giddianhi, the governor of the robbers, but he did cause that his people should cry unto the Lord for strength against the time that the robbers should come down against them. \fi
Lachoneus, the governor, was a fair man, and he would not let himself be frightened by the demands and threats of a robber. He did not do as Giddianhi had said in his letter, but he told his people to cry out to the Lord for strength and protection when the robbers came to attack them.
%3 Nephi 3:13
\bverse \iffalse Yea, he sent a proclamation among all the people, that they should gather together their women, and their children, their flocks and their herds, and all their substance, save it were their land, unto one place. \fi
He sent a proclamation to all the people. He told them to gather their families together, and their flocks and their herds, and everything they owned except for their land, into one place.
%3 Nephi 3:14

And he caused that armies, both of the Nephites and of the Lamanites, or of all them who were numbered among the Nephites, should be placed as guards round about to watch them, and to guard them from the robbers day and night. \fi
He had them build very, very strong forts and defenses around themselves. And he had the armies of the Nephites and Lamanites, who were all called Nephites, stand guard around them and protect them from the robbers, both day and night.
%3 Nephi 3:15
\bverse \iffalse Yea, he said unto them: As the Lord liveth, except ye repent of all your iniquities, and cry unto the Lord, ye will in no wise be delivered out of the hands of those Gadianton robbers. \fi
He said to them: ``Just as the Lord lives, if you do not repent of your sins and cry out to the Lord, you will not be protected from those Gadianton robbers.''
%3 Nephi 3:16
\bverse \iffalse And so great and marvelous were the words and prophecies of Lachoneus that they did cause fear to come upon all the people; and they did exert themselves in their might to do according to the words of Lachoneus. \fi
The things that Lachoneus said and prophesied were so great that they caused the people to be very afraid, and they worked very hard to do what Lachoneus had said.

\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that in the latter end of the eighteenth year those armies of robbers had prepared for battle, and began to come down and to sally forth from the hills, and out of the mountains, and the wilderness, and their strongholds, and their secret places, and began to take possession of the lands, both which were in the land south and which were in the land north, and began to take possession of all the lands which had been deserted by the Nephites, and the cities which had been left desolate. \fi
And at the end of the eighteenth year those armies of robbers had prepared for battle. They began to come down out of the hills, and mountains, and the wilderness. They came down out of their forts and hideouts, and took over the lands in the south and in the north. They took control of the lands that the Nephites had left, and the cities that the Nephites had left empty. 
%3 Nephi 4:2
\bverse \iffalse But behold, there were no wild beasts nor game in those lands which had been deserted by the Nephites, and there was no game for the robbers save it were in the wilderness. \fi
But there were no wild beasts in the lands that the Nephites had left. The wilderness was the only place where the robbers could find animals to hunt.
%3 Nephi 4:3
\bverse \iffalse And the robbers could not exist save it were in the wilderness, for the want of food; for the Nephites had left their lands desolate, and had gathered their flocks and their herds and all their substance, and they were in one body. \fi
And because there was no food, the robbers could not survive anywhere but out in the wilderness. The Nephites had left their lands empty, and had gathered their flocks and herds and everything they owned into one group.
%3 Nephi 4:4
\bverse \iffalse Therefore, there was no chance for the robbers to plunder and to obtain food, save it were to come up in open battle against the Nephites; and the Nephites being in one body, and having so great a number, and having reserved for themselves provisions, and horses and cattle, and flocks of every kind, that they might subsist for the space of seven years, in the which time they did hope to destroy the robbers from off the face of the land; and thus the eighteenth year did pass away. \fi
The robbers had no chance to plunder and get food, unless they came out in open battle against the Nephites. And the Nephites were gathered into one very large group. They had saved food and supplies for themselves, and horses and cattle, and flocks of every kind. They had enough to survive for seven years. They hoped that this would be enough time to completely destroy the robbers. And the eighteenth year ended.
%3 Nephi 4:5

They did not dare to spread out and plant grain and crops, because the Nephites would come and kill them. So this year Giddianhi commanded his armies to go to battle against the Nephites.
%3 Nephi 4:7
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that they did come up to battle; and it was in the sixth month; and behold, great and terrible was the day that they did come up to battle; and they were girded about after the manner of robbers; and they had a lamb-skin about their loins, and they were dyed in blood, and their heads were shorn, and they had head-plates upon them; and great and terrible was the appearance of the armies of Giddianhi, because of their armor, and because of their being dyed in blood. \fi
And in the sixth month, they came marching to battle. That day was terrible, and they were dressed and armored like robbers. They had lambskins around their waists that had been dyed in blood.

And when the armies of Nephites saw Giddianhi's army, they fell to the ground and began to pray to the Lord their God, asking him to save them from their enemies.
%3 Nephi 4:9
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that when the armies of Giddianhi saw this they began to shout with a loud voice, because of their joy, for they had supposed that the Nephites had fallen with fear because of the terror of their armies. \fi
When Giddianhi's armies saw this they began to shout for joy, because they thought that the Nephites were terrified and had fallen with fear.
%3 Nephi 4:10
\bverse \iffalse But in this thing they were disappointed, for the Nephites did not fear them; but they did fear their God and did supplicate him for protection; therefore, when the armies of Giddianhi did rush upon them they were prepared to meet them; yea, in the strength of the Lord they did receive them. \fi
But this was a disappointment for them, because the Nephites were not afraid of them. They feared God, and begged God for protection. And when Giddianhi's armies rushed to attack them, they were prepared. They had the strength of the Lord with them.
%3 Nephi 4:11

%3 Nephi 4:13
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that Gidgiddoni commanded that his armies should pursue them as far as the borders of the wilderness, and that they should not spare any that should fall into their hands by the way; and thus they did pursue them and did slay them, to the borders of the wilderness, even until they had fulfilled the commandment of Gidgiddoni. \fi
And Gidgiddoni commanded his armies to chase them to the borders of the wilderness, and not spare anyone. They chased them to the borders of the wilderness and killed them, just as Gidgiddoni had commanded them.
%3 Nephi 4:14
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that Giddianhi, who had stood and fought with boldness, was pursued as he fled; and being weary because of his much fighting he was overtaken and slain. And thus was the end of Giddianhi the robber. \fi
And Giddianhi, who had fought boldly, was being chased as he ran away. He was exhausted from all the fighting, and Gidgiddoni's armies caught up to him and killed him. This was the end of Giddianhi the robber.

And the armies of the Nephites returned to their forts and defenses. And the nineteenth year ended, and the robbers did not come to battle. They did not come in the twentieth year either.
%3 Nephi 4:16
\bverse \iffalse And in the twenty and first year they did not come up to battle, but they came up on all sides to lay siege round about the people of Nephi; for they did suppose that if they should cut off the people of Nephi from their lands, and should hem them in on every side, and if they should cut them off from all their outward privileges, that they could cause them to yield themselves up according to their wishes. \fi
And in the twenty-first year they did not come to battle. But they came and surrounded the Nephites on every side. They thought that if they kept the Nephites from being able to go to their lands or leave the group, they could get the Nephites to give themselves up.
%3 Nephi 4:17
\bverse \iffalse Now they had appointed unto themselves another leader, whose name was Zemnarihah; therefore it was Zemnarihah that did cause that this siege should take place. \fi
The robbers had appointed another leader who was named Zemnarihah. It was Zemnarihah that had the robbers surround the Nephites.
%3 Nephi 4:18
\bverse \iffalse But behold, this was an advantage to the Nephites; for it was impossible for the robbers to lay siege sufficiently long to have any effect upon the Nephites, because of their much provision which they had laid up in store, \fi
But this was an advantage for the Nephites. It was impossible for the robbers to wait long enough for it to have any effect on the Nephites, because the Nephites had plenty of food and supplies that they had stored.
%3 Nephi 4:19
\bverse \iffalse And because of the scantiness of provisions among the robbers--for behold, they had nothing save it were meat for their subsistence, which meat they did obtain in the wilderness; \fi

And the Nephites marched out during the day and at night. They attacked the armies of the robbers, and killed thousands and tens of thousands of them.
%3 Nephi 4:22
\bverse \iffalse And thus it became the desire of the people of Zemnarihah to withdraw from their design, because of the great destruction which came upon them by night and by day. \fi
Zemnarihah's people wanted to abandon their plan, because they were being killed day and night.
%3 Nephi 4:23
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that Zemnarihah did give command unto his people that they should withdraw themselves from the siege, and march into the furthermost parts of the land northward. \fi
And Zemnarihah commanded his people to stop surrounding the Nephites and march into the farthest parts of the land in the north.
%3 Nephi 4:24
\bverse \iffalse And now, Gidgiddoni being aware of their design, and knowing of their weakness because of the want of food, and the great slaughter which had been made among them, therefore he did send out his armies in the night-time, and did cut off the way of their retreat, and did place his armies in the way of their retreat. \fi
Gidgiddoni realized that this was their plan, and he knew that they were weak because they had little food, and many of them had been killed. So he sent out his armies at night, and had them get ahead of the armies of robbers and cut them off before they could retreat to the north.
%3 Nephi 4:25
\bverse \iffalse And this did they do in the night-time, and got on their march beyond the robbers, so that on the morrow, when the robbers began their march, they were met by the armies of the Nephites both in their front and in their rear. \fi
They did this, and they got past the robbers. And the next day, when the robbers began their march, they ran into the armies of the Nephites both in front of them and from behind.
%3 Nephi 4:26
\bverse \iffalse And the robbers who were on the south were also cut off in their places of retreat. And all these things were done by command of Gidgiddoni. \fi
And the robbers who were to the south were also cut off before they could retreat. And it was Gidgiddoni who commanded all of this to happen.

And there were many thousands who gave themselves up and became the prisoners of the Nephites. And the rest of them were killed.
%3 Nephi 4:28
\bverse \iffalse And their leader, Zemnarihah, was taken and hanged upon a tree, yea, even upon the top thereof until he was dead. And when they had hanged him until he was dead they did fell the tree to the earth, and did cry with a loud voice, saying: \fi
And their leader, Zemnarihah, was taken and hanged on a tree. And after they hanged him they cut the tree down and cried out with a loud voice, saying:
%3 Nephi 4:29
\bverse \iffalse May the Lord preserve his people in righteousness and in holiness of heart, that they may cause to be felled to the earth all who shall seek to slay them because of power and secret combinations, even as this man hath been felled to the earth. \fi

\bverse \iffalse Behold, this is not my doctrine, to stir up the hearts of men with anger, one against another; but this is my doctrine, that such things should be done away. \fi

I have given them power to baptize you with water. Any of you who obeys the words that they speak will find happiness. And after you are baptized with water, I will baptize you with fire and with the Holy Ghost. Now that you have seen me and you know that I exist, if you will believe in me and be baptized, you will be blessed.
