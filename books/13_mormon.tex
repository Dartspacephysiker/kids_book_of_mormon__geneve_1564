Around the time that Ammaron hid the records and asked the Lord to protect them, he came to me. I was about ten years old, and I had started to learn the ways of my people. Ammaron said to me: ``I see that you are smart, and that you pay close attention to what happens around you.

But the land was filled with robbers and Lamanites. And even though my people were about to be destroyed, they did not repent of the evil things that they were doing. There was blood and death over all the land, among the Nephites and the Lamanites. The entire land was covered in war.
%Mormon 2:9

%Mormon 2:10
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that the Nephites began to repent of their iniquity, and began to cry even as had been prophesied by Samuel the prophet; for behold no man could keep that which was his own, for the thieves, and the robbers, and the murderers, and the magic art, and the witchcraft which was in the land. \fi

\bverse \iffalse But behold this my joy was vain, for their sorrowing was not unto repentance, because of the goodness of God; but it was rather the sorrowing of the damned, because the Lord would not always suffer them to take happiness in sin. \fi
But I found out that my joy was empty. They were not sorry because they wanted to repent, because of God's goodness. They were sorry like a person who has already been judged guilty. The Lord was not going to always let them have joy in living sinful lives.
%Mormon 2:14
\bverse \iffalse And they did not come unto Jesus with broken hearts and contrite spirits, but they did curse God, and wish to die.  Nevertheless they would struggle with the sword for their lives. \fi

%Mormon 2:15
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that my sorrow did return unto me again, and I saw that the day of grace was passed with them, both temporally and spiritually; for I saw thousands of them hewn down in open rebellion against their God, and heaped up as dung upon the face of the land. And thus three hundred and forty and four years had passed away. \fi
Then I was filled with sadness again. I saw that God's grace was no longer with them, either in this life or the next.

%Mormon 2:16

%Mormon 2:17
\bverse \iffalse And now, the city of Jashon was near the land where Ammaron had deposited the records unto the Lord, that they might not be destroyed. And behold I had gone according to the word of Ammaron, and taken the plates of Nephi, and did make a record according to the words of Ammaron. \fi
The city of Jashon was near the land where Ammaron had buried the records and asked the Lord to protect them, so that they would not be destroyed. I had done what Ammaron told me to do: I took the plates of Nephi, and made a record according to the instructions that Ammaron had given me.
%Mormon 2:18
\bverse \iffalse And upon the plates of Nephi I did make a full account of all the wickedness and abominations; but upon these plates I did forbear to make a full account of their wickedness and abominations, for behold, a continual scene of wickedness and abominations has been before mine eyes ever since I have been sufficient to behold the ways of man. \fi
I gave the full story of all the wickedness and horrible things I had seen on the plates of Nephi. But I decided not to tell the full story of the wickedness and horrible things I saw on these plates. Ever since I was old enough to understand what people around me were doing, I have seen nothing but wickedness and horribly evil things happening.
%Mormon 2:19
\bverse \iffalse And wo is me because of their wickedness; for my heart has been filled with sorrow because of their wickedness, all my days; nevertheless, I know that I shall be lifted up at the last day. \fi
It fills me with great sadness to see how wicked they are. My heart has been full of pain my whole life because of their wickedness. But I know that I will be lifted up to be with God on the last day.

\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that in this year the people of Nephi again were hunted and driven. And it came to pass that we were driven forth until we had come northward to the land which was called Shem. \fi
And during this year, the people of Nephi were hunted and scattered. We were driven out until we had come northward to the land that was called Shem.

And during the three hundred and forty-sixtn year, they began to attack us again.
%Mormon 2:23

I spoke to my people, and encouraged them with all of my energy, to fight against the Lamanites for their families, and their houses and homes.

My words did at least get them to fight, so that they did not run away from the Lamanites. They fought boldly against them.
%Mormon 2:25

We fought against their army of fifty thousand soldiers with our army of thirty-thousand soldiers. We fought them so fiercely that they started to run from us.
%Mormon 2:26
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that when they had fled we did pursue them with our armies, and did meet them again, and did beat them; nevertheless the strength of the Lord was not with us; yea, we were left to ourselves, that the Spirit of the Lord did not abide in us; therefore we had become weak like unto our brethren. \fi
When they began to run from us we chased them with our armies, and caught up to them and beat them. But the Lord's strength was not with us. We were left to fight on our own, without the Spirit of the Lord inside us. We had become weak like our sisters and brothers, the Lamanites.
%Mormon 2:27
\bverse \iffalse And my heart did sorrow because of this the great calamity of my people, because of their wickedness and their abominations.  But behold, we did go forth against the Lamanites and the robbers of Gadianton, until we had again taken possession of the lands of our inheritance. \fi
My heart was full of sorrow because of the downfall of my people. They were being destroyed because of their wickedness and horrible sins. But we went and fought against the Lamanites and the Gadianton robbers until we had gotten control of our own lands again.
%Mormon 2:28

%Mormon 3:2
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that the Lord did say unto me: Cry unto this people--Repent ye, and come unto me, and be ye baptized, and build up again my church, and ye shall be spared. \fi

%Mormon 3:3
