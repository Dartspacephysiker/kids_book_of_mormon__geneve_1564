\bchapter
%Ether 2:1
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that Jared and his brother, and their families, and also the friends of Jared and his brother and their families, went down into the valley which was northward, (and the name of the valley was Nimrod, being called after the mighty hunter) with their flocks which they had gathered together, male and female, of every kind. \fi
And Jared and his brother, and their families, and the friends of Jared and his brother and their families, went down into the valley in the north. This valley was named after the mighty hunter, Nimrod. They went with flocks of every kind, male and female, that they had gathered.
%Ether 2:2
\bverse \iffalse And they did also lay snares and catch fowls of the air; and they did also prepare a vessel, in which they did carry with them the fish of the waters. \fi
They also lay traps to catch different kinds of birds. And they made a special container to carry different kinds of fish with them.
%Ether 2:3
\bverse \iffalse And they did also carry with them deseret, which, by interpretation, is a honey bee; and thus they did carry with them swarms of bees, and all manner of that which was upon the face of the land, seeds of every kind. \fi
They also took honey bees with them. (In their language the word for honey bee is deseret.) And so they carried swarms of bees, and all sorts of seeds and other things from their land.
%Ether 2:4
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that when they had come down into the valley of Nimrod the Lord came down and talked with the brother of Jared; and he was in a cloud, and the brother of Jared saw him not. \fi
And when they had come down into the valley of Nimrod, the Lord came down and spoke with the brother of Jared. He was in a cloud, and the brother of Jared could not see him.
%Ether 2:5
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that the Lord commanded them that they should go forth into the wilderness, yea, into that quarter where there never had man been. And it came to pass that the Lord did go before them, and did talk with them as he stood in a cloud, and gave directions whither they should travel. \fi
The Lord commanded them to go into the wilderness, and into a part where no human had ever been. The Lord went in front of them, and spoke with them as he stood in a cloud, and told them where to travel.
%Ether 2:6
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that they did travel in the wilderness, and did build barges, in which they did cross many waters, being directed continually by the hand of the Lord. \fi
So they traveled in the wilderness, and built barges to cross many waters. And the Lord's hand directed them the whole time.
%Ether 2:7
\bverse \iffalse And the Lord would not suffer that they should stop beyond the sea in the wilderness, but he would that they should come forth even unto the land of promise, which was choice above all other lands, which the Lord God had preserved for a righteous people. \fi
And the Lord would not allow them to stop at the sea in the wilderness. He wanted them to come to the land he had promised, which was more wonderful than any other land. The Lord God had saved this land for a people who would be righteous
%Ether 2:8
\bverse \iffalse And he had sworn in his wrath unto the brother of Jared, that whoso should possess this land of promise, from that time henceforth and forever, should serve him, the true and only God, or they should be swept off when the fulness of his wrath should come upon them. \fi
And he swore in his anger to the brother of Jared that anyone who lived in the land of promise, forever from that time forward, must serve him, the true and only God. If not, they would be swept off the land when he, in his great anger, punished them.
%Ether 2:9
\bverse \iffalse And now, we can behold the decrees of God concerning this land, that it is a land of promise; and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall serve God, or they shall be swept off when the fulness of his wrath shall come upon them. And the fulness of his wrath cometh upon them when they are ripened in iniquity. \fi
Now we can see the things that God said about this land. It is a promised land, and any nation who lives on it must serve God. If not, they will be swept away and destroyed when he, in his great anger, punishes them. His great anger will come when they become a wicked people and they destroy the righteous.
%Ether 2:10
\bverse \iffalse For behold, this is a land which is choice above all other lands; wherefore he that doth possess it shall serve God or shall be swept off; for it is the everlasting decree of God. And it is not until the fulness of iniquity among the children of the land, that they are swept off. \fi
This is a land that is more wonderful and blessed than any other land. So the people who live here must serve God or be swept away. This is what God has proclaimed. And they will not be swept away until they are full of evil.
%Ether 2:11
\bverse \iffalse And this cometh unto you, O ye Gentiles, that ye may know the decrees of God--that ye may repent, and not continue in your iniquities until the fulness come, that ye may not bring down the fulness of the wrath of God upon you as the inhabitants of the land have hitherto done. \fi
This comes to you, you non-Israelites, so that you can know what God has proclaimed, and so that you can repent and stop living sinfully. If you do not, you will bring God's great anger on yourselves, as the people who lived in this land before you have done.
%Ether 2:12
\bverse \iffalse Behold, this is a choice land, and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall be free from bondage, and from captivity, and from all other nations under heaven, if they will but serve the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ, who hath been manifested by the things which we have written. \fi
This land is blessed. Any nation that lives on it will be free from slavery and from all other nations on Earth, if they serve the God of the land, Jesus Christ. He is the one that has been revealed by what we have written.
%Ether 2:13
\bverse \iffalse And now I proceed with my record; for behold, it came to pass that the Lord did bring Jared and his brethren forth even to that great sea which divideth the lands. And as they came to the sea they pitched their tents; and they called the name of the place Moriancumer; and they dwelt in tents, and dwelt in tents upon the seashore for the space of four years. \fi
And now I continue my record. The Lord brought Jared and the people traveling with him to the great sea that divides the lands. When they came to the sea they pitched their tents. They called that place Moriancumer, and they lived in tents on the seashore for four years.
%Ether 2:14
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass at the end of four years that the Lord came again unto the brother of Jared, and stood in a cloud and talked with him. And for the space of three hours did the Lord talk with the brother of Jared, and chastened him because he remembered not to call upon the name of the Lord. \fi
And after four years the Lord came to the brother of Jared again, and stood in a cloud and talked with him. The Lord talked with the brother of Jared for three hours, and corrected him because he did not remember to pray to the Lord.
%Ether 2:15
\bverse \iffalse And the brother of Jared repented of the evil which he had done, and did call upon the name of the Lord for his brethren who were with him. And the Lord said unto him: I will forgive thee and thy brethren of their sins; but thou shalt not sin any more, for ye shall remember that my Spirit will not always strive with man; wherefore, if ye will sin until ye are fully ripe ye shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord. And these are my thoughts upon the land which I shall give you for your inheritance; for it shall be a land choice above all other lands. \fi
And the brother of Jared repented for the evil thing he had done. He prayed to the Lord for his friends and family who were with him. And the Lord said to him: ``I will forgive you and the people with you for their sins. But you must not sin anymore; remember that my Spirit will not always stay with you. And if you sin until you do only evil, you will be cut off from the Lord. These are my feelings about the land that I will give to you for an inheritance. It will be a land that is blessed more than any other land.''
%Ether 2:16
\bverse \iffalse And the Lord said: Go to work and build, after the manner of barges which ye have hitherto built. And it came to pass that the brother of Jared did go to work, and also his brethren, and built barges after the manner which they had built, according to the instructions of the Lord. And they were small, and they were light upon the water, even like unto the lightness of a fowl upon the water. \fi
And the Lord said: ``Go to work and build barges like the ones you have built before.'' So the brother of Jared went to work with the people who were with him, and they built barges like they had before, just as the Lord had commanded. They were small barges that were light on the water. They were as light as a bird on the water.
%Ether 2:17
\bverse \iffalse And they were built after a manner that they were exceedingly tight, even that they would hold water like unto a dish; and the bottom thereof was tight like unto a dish; and the sides thereof were tight like unto a dish; and the ends thereof were peaked; and the top thereof was tight like unto a dish; and the length thereof was the length of a tree; and the door thereof, when it was shut, was tight like unto a dish. \fi
And they were very tight, so that they could keep water out like a dish. The bottom and sides were tight like a dish. The ends turned upward and peaked, and the top was like a dish. The barges were as long as a tree, and when the door was shut, it was as tight as a dish.
%Ether 2:18
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that the brother of Jared cried unto the Lord, saying: O Lord, I have performed the work which thou hast commanded me, and I have made the barges according as thou hast directed me. \fi
And the brother of Jared cried to the Lord, and said: ``O Lord, I have done the work you commanded me to do, and I have followed your instructions and made the barges.
%Ether 2:19
\bverse \iffalse And behold, O Lord, in them there is no light; whither shall we steer? And also we shall perish, for in them we cannot breathe, save it is the air which is in them; therefore we shall perish. \fi
Look, O Lord; there is no light in them. How will we steer? And also, we can only breathe the air that is in them. We will die!''
%Ether 2:20
\bverse \iffalse And the Lord said unto the brother of Jared: Behold, thou shalt make a hole in the top, and also in the bottom; and when thou shalt suffer for air thou shalt unstop the hole and receive air. And if it be so that the water come in upon thee, behold, ye shall stop the hole, that ye may not perish in the flood. \fi
And the Lord said to the brother of Jared: ``You shall make a hole in the top, and in the bottom. When you need air, open the hole and let air come in. And if the water starts to come in, close the hole so that you do not die in the water.''
%Ether 2:21
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that the brother of Jared did so, according as the Lord had commanded. \fi
So this is what the brother of Jared did, as the Lord had commanded.
%Ether 2:22
\bverse \iffalse And he cried again unto the Lord saying: O Lord, behold I have done even as thou hast commanded me; and I have prepared the vessels for my people, and behold there is no light in them.  Behold, O Lord, wilt thou suffer that we shall cross this great water in darkness? \fi
He cried out to the Lord again, and said: ``O Lord, I have done what you told me to do. I have prepared these barges for my people, but there is still no light in them. O Lord, do you expect us to cross the great water in darkness?''
%Ether 2:23
\bverse \iffalse And the Lord said unto the brother of Jared: What will ye that I should do that ye may have light in your vessels? For behold, ye cannot have windows, for they will be dashed in pieces; neither shall ye take fire with you, for ye shall not go by the light of fire. \fi
And the Lord said to the brother of Jared: ``What do you want me to do so that you can have light in your barges? You cannot have windows; they will be broken in pieces. You can't use fire, either.
%Ether 2:24
\bverse \iffalse For behold, ye shall be as a whale in the midst of the sea; for the mountain waves shall dash upon you. Nevertheless, I will bring you up again out of the depths of the sea; for the winds have gone forth out of my mouth, and also the rains and the floods have I sent forth. \fi
You will be like a whale in the middle of the sea. The mountain waves will crash on you. But I will bring you up again out of the depths of the sea, because the winds go where I command them to, and the rains and floods do as I command.
%Ether 2:25
\bverse \iffalse And behold, I prepare you against these things; for ye cannot cross this great deep save I prepare you against the waves of the sea, and the winds which have gone forth, and the floods which shall come. Therefore what will ye that I should prepare for you that ye may have light when ye are swallowed up in the depths of the sea? \fi
I am preparing you for these things. You cannot cross these great, deep waters unless I prepare you to protect yourselves against the waves of the sea, and the winds, and the floods. So what do you want me to prepare for you so that you can have light when you are swallowed up in the depths of the sea?''
%Chapter 3
\bchapter
%Ether 3:1
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that the brother of Jared, (now the number of the vessels which had been prepared was eight) went forth unto the mount, which they called the mount Shelem, because of its exceeding height, and did molten out of a rock sixteen small stones; and they were white and clear, even as transparent glass; and he did carry them in his hands upon the top of the mount, and cried again unto the Lord, saying: \fi
They had made eight barges. And the brother of Jared went into the mountain that they called Shelem, because it was very high, and he melted the rock there, and made sixteen small stones. They were white and clear, like glass. He carried them in his hands on top of the mountain, and cried out to the Lord again:
%Ether 3:2
\bverse \iffalse O Lord, thou hast said that we must be encompassed about by the floods. Now behold, O Lord, and do not be angry with thy servant because of his weakness before thee; for we know that thou art holy and dwellest in the heavens, and that we are unworthy before thee; because of the fall our natures have become evil continually; nevertheless, O Lord, thou hast given us a commandment that we must call upon thee, that from thee we may receive according to our desires. \fi
``O Lord, you have said that we must be surrounded by the floods. O Lord, do not be angry with me, your servant, because I am weak. We know that you are holy and live in the heavens, and that we are not worthy before you. Because of the fall we have become evil. But, O Lord, you have commanded us to call on you for help, so that we can receive the things that we need and want.
%Ether 3:3
\bverse \iffalse Behold, O Lord, thou hast smitten us because of our iniquity, and hast driven us forth, and for these many years we have been in the wilderness; nevertheless, thou hast been merciful unto us.  O Lord, look upon me in pity, and turn away thine anger from this thy people, and suffer not that they shall go forth across this raging deep in darkness; but behold these things which I have molten out of the rock. \fi
O Lord, you have punished us because of our sins, and you have led us. We have been in the wilderness for many years. You have been merciful to us. Please have pity on me, O Lord, and do not be angry at us, your people. Please help us so that we do not have to cross the deep, raging waters in darkness. Look at these things that I have molten out of the rock.
%Ether 3:4
\bverse \iffalse And I know, O Lord, that thou hast all power, and can do whatsoever thou wilt for the benefit of man; therefore touch these stones, O Lord, with thy finger, and prepare them that they may shine forth in darkness; and they shall shine forth unto us in the vessels which we have prepared, that we may have light while we shall cross the sea. \fi
I know, O Lord, that you have all power. You can do whatever you wish to help humankind. So touch these stones with your finger, O Lord, and prepare them so that they can shine in darkness. They will shine for us in the vessels we have made, so that we have light while we cross the sea.
%Ether 3:5
\bverse \iffalse Behold, O Lord, thou canst do this. We know that thou art able to show forth great power, which looks small unto the understanding of men. \fi
O Lord, you can do this. We know that you have great power that looks small to the understanding of humans.''
%Ether 3:6
\bverse \iffalse And it came to pass that when the brother of Jared had said these words, behold, the Lord stretched forth his hand and touched the stones one by one with his finger. And the veil was taken from off the eyes of the brother of Jared, and he saw the finger of the Lord; and it was as the finger of a man, like unto flesh and blood; and the brother of Jared fell down before the Lord, for he was struck with fear. \fi
And when the brother of Jared had said these words, the Lord stretched out his hand and touched the stones, one by one, with his finger.

And he said to the Lord: ``I saw the finger of the Lord, and I was afraid that the Lord would punish me. I did not know that the Lord had flesh and blood.''
%Ether 3:9
\bverse \iffalse And the Lord said unto him: Because of thy faith thou hast seen that I shall take upon me flesh and blood; and never has man come before me with such exceeding faith as thou hast; for were it not so ye could not have seen my finger. Sawest thou more than this? \fi
And the Lord said to him: ``Because of your faith you have seen that someday I will have a body of flesh and blood. No one has ever come to me with such great faith as you have. If you did not have such great faith, you could not have seen my finger. Did you see more than this?''

And he answered: ``No. Lord, show yourself to me.''
